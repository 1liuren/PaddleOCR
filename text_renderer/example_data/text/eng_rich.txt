Preface
For nearly 75 years， TIME has reported on the latest
trends in world politics， science and culture for an informed
audience around the world. It sets the agenda for discussion of
important issues for influential citizens in every nation.
for elegance and clarity of expression in English. Their way
with words has been widely imitated but perhaps never
improved upon. Much of the pleasure for TIME's most faithful
readers comes from the magazine's unique way of telling a
story in fresh， lively terms.
So to learn how to communicate not just clearly but
elegantly， the vocabulary and expressions employed in TIME
make a great place to start. We are delighted to make available
to native Chinese-language readers these unique guides to the
language of TIME. We are confident these will be a valuable
aide to the user's understanding， not just of what is reported in
TIME each week， but of all the rapid changes in the world
around us.

Introduction to
TIME Express， a Chinese-English bilingual edition of
TIME Magazine， was launched in January， 1996. I have kept
several English-learning columns going since the very first
issue. Since then， some of these columns have been
discontinued and published in book form under the series
heading of “English Magician.” Among the few “senior”
columns that started with the very first issue， TIME Key
Phrases 200 is the last one to be collected in book form.
The“Phrases”column has now been running in TIME
Express for five-and-a-half years. During this time， the format
first sought out the high-frequency phrases in TIME that
required annotation， and then found examples in the TIME
archives to illustrate the usage of those phrases. In this way，
some of the examples I used were taken from older issues of
TIME. Then a reader wrote to me and suggested that examples
in the “Phrases” column be more up-to-date. I found this
suggestion quite sensible， and accordingly changed the way the
column was written.

TIME
As Chief Editorial Writer for TIME Express， I have a
number of duties， reading magazines being one of them—I read
through every weekly issue of TIME and pick out appropriate
stories to recommend to the editorial staff of TIME Express，
which meets once a week to decide on the stories that will go
into each month's issue. Now， when I read the latest issue of
TIME every week， I mark the noteworthy phrases and idioms，
and choose among these to include in the “Phrases” column. In
this way， readers are always presented with the latest examples.
Although some of the examples in the present collection are
in them are still equally useful and relevant.
Most of the phrases and idioms in this collection are
commonly used， but they tend to be above average in level of
difficulty. These are phrases that illuminate the TIME style.
Quite a few are imports from French or Latin， and there is no
shortage of colloquialisms. Also included are phrases
commonly used in journalistic English. I have provided
background information or annotations for every phrase to help
the reader fully understand them and commit them to memory
more easily.
vii
TIME
Every phrase in this collection is coupled with an actual
example from TIME Magazine. Examples are chosen that best
highlight the usage of the phrases. In cases where examples
taken out of context may be unclear， I provide relevant
background within the translation to better facilitate
understanding.
Phrases， like words， are important elements in the
formation of English sentences. This collection of TIME Key
Phrases 200 was five-and-a-half years in the making. It is a
reference tool that sheds light on the language of TIME， and as

The History of Everything
Our whole universe was in a hot dense state.
Then nearly fourteen billion years ago expansion started. Wait.
The Earth began to cool，
The autotrophs began to drool，
Neanderthals developed tools.
We built a wall (we built the pyramids)，
Math，science， history， unraveling the mysteries，
That all started with the big bang!
Since the dawn of man is really not that long，
As every galaxy was formed in less time than it takes to sing this song.
A fraction of a second and the elements were made.
The bipeds stood up straight.
The dinosaurs all met their fate.
They tried to leap but they were late，
And they all died (they froze their asses off).
The oceans and pangea，
See ya， wouldn't wanna be ya!
Set in motion by the same big bang!
It all started with the big bang!
It's expanding ever outward but one day
It will cause the stars to go the other way，
Collapsing ever inward， we won't be here， it won’t be hurt.
Our best and brightest figure that it’ll make an even bigger bang!
Debating out while here they're catching deer (we re catching viruses).
Religion or astronomy，Encarta，Deuteronomy，
It all started with the big bang!
Music and mythology， Einstein and astrology，
It all started with the big bang!

Sheldon： No. We're gonna start Season
Two of Battle Star Galactica②.

bors， invite her over， and make her

Sheldon： Chat? We don't chat.

No... I sit there.O2
Penny： What's the difference?
Sheldon： What's the difference?
Leonard： Here we go.
②
Sheldon： In the winter， that seat is close e-
nough to the radiator to remain③ warm， al
and
yet not so close as to cause perspiration. In
the summer， it's directly in the path of a
cross-breeze created by opening windows
there and there. It faces the television at an
angle that is neither direct， thus⑤discourag-
ing conversation， nor so far wide as to
to⑥
create a parallax distortion. I could go on，
but I think I've made my point⑦.

It'd be a more merciful death.O4
Leonard： Excuse me， your entire argument is
predicated on the assumption that superman's
flight is a feat of strength...⑤
Sheldon： Are you listening to yourself? It is
well established that his flight is a feat of
strength. It is an extension of his ability to
leap tall buildings， an ability he derives
from exposure to earth's yellow sun.
Howard： And how does he fly at night?

Sheldon：
Well.I assume she meant the
two of you together would constitute
a couple that others might consider
cute.O1An alternate and somewhat
less likely
interpretation is that you
could manufacture one.② As in，“Oh，
look，Leonard and Leslie made Mr.and
Mrs. Goldfarb. Aren't they adorable”?
Leonard： If Penny didn't know that Leslie
had turned me down②，then it would un-
ambiguously mean t
that she，Penny，
thought I should ask her， Leslie， out， in-
in me asking her，Penny，out. But， be-
cause she did knowthat I had asked

Sheldon： Assuming②a device could be inven-
“
and transmit that pattern toa distant loca-
tion for reassembly， you would not have
actually
transportedthe
individual.
You
would have destroyed him in one location
and recreated him in another.
Sheldon：Personally，I would never use a
transporter，because the original Sheldon
would have to be disintegrated in order to5
create a new Sheldon.
Leonard：
Would the new Sheldon be in any

question，“What is the quantum mechanical

work.

meeting.

came from， but it could not have been a
team meeting because I'm on the team and I
wasn't there.

meet.C2

Swiss and lettuce on whole wheat.O1
It's the right ingredients， but in the
wrong order.O In a proper sandwich，
the cheese is adjacent to the bread to create
a
moisture barrier against the lettuce.
They might as well have dragged

things. Good for me. 2

Sheldon： Oh， wait. Did you want to talk about
what's bothering you?
Leonard： I don't know. Maybe.
Sheldon： Wow. I'm on fire tonight.3
Leonard： Uh... here's the thing. Girls like
Penny never end up withg

Sheldon： I disagree.
Your inability to suc-
cessfully woo Penny long predates your
acquisition of the time machine. 4 That
failure clearly stands on its own⑤.
Leonard： Thanks for pointing it out.
Sheldon： In addition， your premise is flawed.
In the original film， Rod Taylor got Yvette
Mimieux with that very time machine. In
“Back to the Future”，Marty McFly got the
opportunity to hook up with his extremely
attractive young mother.

an experiment where a cat is placed in a
box with a sealed vial of poison that will
。
break open at arandom time. Now，since④
no one knows when or if the poison has
been released， until the box is opened， the
cat can be thought of as both alive and
dead.

I haven't made it yet.O You’d have to be
psychic to get it， and there's no such thing

Penny： Sheldon， what's the point?!
Sheldon： Just like Schrodinger's cat， your po-
tential relationship with Leonard right now-
can be thought of asboth good and bad. It
is only by opening the box that you'll find
out which it is. ⑥

For nearly 75 years， TIME has reported on the latest trends in world
politics， science and culture for an informed audience around the world. It
sets the agenda for discussion of important issues for influential citizens in
every nation.
Similarly， its editors and writers have long set the standard for
elegance and clarity of expression in English. Their way with words has
been widely imitated but perhaps never improved upon. Much of the
pleasure for TIME's most faithful readers comes from the magazine's
unique way of telling a story in fresh， lively terms.
So to learn how to communicate not just clearly but elegantly， the
vocabulary and expressions employed in TIME make a great place to start.
We are delighted to make available to native Chinese-language readers
these unique guides to the language of TIME. We are confident these will
in TIME each week， but of all the rapid changes in the world around us.

The History of Everything
Our whole universe was in a hot dense state.
Then nearly fourteen billion years ago expansion started. Wait.
The Earth began to cool，
Neanderthals developed tools.
We built a wall (we built the pyramids)，
Math，science， history， unraveling the mysteries，
That all started with the big bang!
Since the dawn of man is really not that long，
As every galaxy was formed in less time than it takes to sing this song.
The bipeds stood up straight.
The dinosaurs all met their fate.
They tried to leap but they were late，
And they all died (they froze their asses off).
The oceans and pangea，
See ya， wouldn't wanna be ya!
Set in motion by the same big bang!
It all started with the big bang!
It's expanding ever outward but one day
It will cause the stars to go the other way，
Collapsing ever inward， we won’t be here， it won’t be hurt.
Our best and brightest figure that it'll make an even bigger bang!
Australopithecus would really have been sick of us
Debating out while here they re catching deer (we're catching viruses).
Religion or astronomy，Encarta， Deuteronomy，
It all started with the big bang!
Music and mythology， Einstein and astrology，
It all started with the big bang!

One cries because one is sad. For
example， I cry because others are
stupid， and that makes me sad.
You're afraid of insects and
you catatonic.

What are you looking at? You've
never seen a hypocrite before?

I'm not crazy—my I

tested.
-Sheldon
I don't want to go back to India. It's hot and loud， and there are so many
people. You have no idea—they're everywhere.

Sometimes I don't listen. Sometimes I just
watch your jaw go up and down.
You give speeches all the time.
What you can't do is shut up.

Penny： Yeah.
had to express that desire before revealing
or not I wanted to accept the covenant of
secret keeping.
g. You can't impose a secret
on an ex post facto basis.1
Penny：
What?O2
Sheldon： Secret keeping is a complicated en-
deavor. One has to be concerned not only
about what one says， but about facial ex-
pressions，autonomic reflexes. When I try
to deceive， I myself have more nervous tics
than a Lyme disease①research facility. It's
a joke.3It relies on the homonymic rela-
tionship between“tick”，the blood sucking
arachnid， and“tic” the involuntary muscular
contraction.
I made it up
myself.

Penny： Okay. Look， if Leonard finds out that 1
lied， I will absolutely die of embarrassment.

Penny： Well， it wasn’t the first suggestion that
came to mind，
，but it’s the one I'm going
with.O
Sheldon： I can't sleep on your couch. I sleep
in a bed. And given its dimensions， I have
no intention of living out E. M. Snickering's
beloved children's book②，The Tall Man
from Cornwall③.
Penny： What?
Sheldon：“There was a tall man from Cornwall
whose length exceeded his bed. My body
fits on it， but barely upon it.
There's no
room for my big Cornish head.”3
Penny： All right， I will give you my bed on one
condition that you promise to zip your hole
for the next eight hours.
Sheldon： May I say one last thing⑤?
Penny： Only if it doesn't rhyme.
Sheldon： All right. Good night.

tional Space Station① where it will deploy

Raj： Get over yourself. It's a high-tech toilet.
Leonard： Just think. Thanks to your hard work，
an international crew of astronauts will
go where no man has gone before.”O2
Howard： Is that supposed to be funny?
Sheldon：
：I believe it is. O： The combination
of the Star Trek reference and the play on
words involving the double-meaning of the
verb“ to go③” suggests that Leonard is
mocking your efforts in space plumbing.
Howard： Okay， make your little jokes④， but

know， living in the moment. Although I do
have to live a little in the future， 'cause
that's my job. Of course， my fondness for
classic science fiction does draw my atten-

backwards，but those stories often
take place③ in the future. In conclusion④，
no，it doesn't bother me.
Penny： Okay， well， that's really cool of you.
Leonard： I wouldn't say cool. I'd just say...
“That's Leonard!”
Penny： In that case⑤，
，do you mind giving me
some advice?O4
Leonard： About Stuart? Love to.
Penny： He's very shy. How do I make him feel
more comfortable around me?
Leonard： First of all⑥，don’t underestimate the
value of discomfort.

Leonard： Stuart thrives under pressure. That's
why he works in a comic book store.

Compiling a Shakespeare Dictionary
for Chinese Students
LIU BINGSHAN
Henan University，China
Shakespeare is a great topic， about which I can only speak from the view of a Chinese
teacher of English literature.
Shakespeare has been introduced to China for more than a hundred years. We have now two
Chinese prose versions of Complete Shakespeare. A Chinese poetry version of Complete
Shakespeare appeared at the end of the twentieth century. Our people usually read Shakespeare
through these Chinese versions， and Shakespeare has become one of the favourite Western
writers and dramatists among our readers and audience. But， so far as the study of Shakespeare is
concerned，translation cannot take the place of the original. It is unthinkable to make a serious
a question sometimes puzzling us at present.
May I take my own experience to illustrate how an ordinary Chinese scholar has been
groping his way in studying and teaching Shakespeare? My first play of Shakespeare was Romeo
and Juliet which I read at middle school through the beautiful translation made by Cao Yu， the
most famous playwright in modern China. The happy impression encouraged me to read the play
in the original as soon as I studied English at university. I embarked on this pleasant task with a
7
little pocket Temple edition of the original play. At first， the peculiarities of Shakespeare's
h.vo
language appeared very interesting and I brushed aside all obstacles with youthful high spirits.
Then I planned to read over The Oxford Shakespeare from cover to cover with the help of The
Concise Oxford Dictionary. But I could only get over the first two or three plays before I put
down the big volume with a strong feeling that the language gap between Shakespeare and me was
unsurmountable in spite of my warm love of him.
Many years later， when I taught English literature at university， I tried by all means to get
reference books about Shakespeare， and succeeded in buying from second-hand bookshops in
Beijing and Shanghai， in early sixties， Hamlet，The Merchant of Venice ， As You Like It， and
Henry IV， edited separately by E. K. Chambers， K. Deighton， and A. W. Verity. The greatest
acquisition in my search of books was an Arden Hamlet which was borrowed from an old
professor of our department. Armed with these good editions， I could better understand
Shakespeare and prepare my lecture about him with greater confidence. I also wanted to get some
Shakespeare dictionary or grammar， but it was then nowhere to be obtained.
The Cultural Revolution played havoc with academic researches. Our Shakespearean studies
revived after the end of the Cultural Revolution. But its calamitous effect is deep-going. For one
thing， the second-hand bookshops where we could formerly pick a few good old editions of
made it
t impossible for ordinary Chinese
scholars
S
to buy up-to-d
ate
I
publications about
Shakespeare. Universities in Beijing and Shanghai may be better furnished with stoeks of books
about Shakespeare. But， as far as I know， it is verging on impossibility， even now， to find in our
provincial
L
universities
and
loca.
1
colleges，any indispensable Shakespeare
Shakespeare dictionary and
grammar， and whole sets of authoritative editions of Shakespeare. Under such conditions，the
study of Shakespeare's original remains the business of a very limited number of learned scholars
who either studied Shakespeare in Britain and America long ago， or have in recent years the
chances of making advanced studies abroad. Meanwhile， most of our students can only rely on
Chinese translation， or mere stories from Shakespeare， to satisfy their ardent desire to study
Shakespeare. For them， the original Shakespeare is still a closed book.
Shakespeare wrote in Early Modern English， which is now four centuries old. From the days
of Shakespeare， the English language has changed greatly.“Time has placed an ever-increasing
cloud before the mirror he held to life.”Anyone who tries to read Shakespeare's original without
any preparation in advance can only“see through a glass，darkly.”A British Shakespeare
ionary compiler has pointed out bluntly：“The Shakespearean langu
t
greater than is sometimes supposed， a dead tongue to us， and can be thoroughly mastered only by
study with the aid of grammar， dictionary and comment.”(R.J.Cunliffe： Preface to A New
Shakespearean Dictionary，1910.) So the study of his language becomes a pre-requisite for the
study of his drama.
“An accurate apprehension of a poet's meaning is a condition precedent to a
full appreciation of his poetry.”(Ibid.)
The same is true of the drama of Yuan dynasty (1271―1368)，one of our treasures of
classical Chinese literature. Yuan drama used a language which on the one hand inherited ancient
literary Chinese and on the other absorbed a large amount of contemporary vernacular with
numerous words and expressions which represent the particular customs， fashions，institutions
and ways of life belonging exclusively to that period of Chinese history. These peculiar words and
expressions constitute the language difficulties for present-day readers. So dictionaries of Yuan
drama have been compiled by Chinese scholars to solve this problem.
It is said that even the students of Britain and America today find it hard to read
Shakespeare owing to language difficulties. Then the difficulties will be twice or thrice as great to
Chinese students， because for them Shakespeare's language is not only a foreign language， but
also an ancient one.
As a teacher of English literature， I have long been thinking of how to make Shakespeare
easily accessible to our students. A chance obtaining of A Pocket Shakespeare Lexicon struck me
8
with the idea of translating it into Chinese. But I gave up the thought because the little book is
not enough for us. How about other dictionaries published abroad? Neither of them is completely
suitable for our special needs. A Shakespeare dictionary for Chinese students can only be
compiled by a Chinese scholar. Such a dictionary should explain all the difficult words and
expressions in the Complete Works of Shakespeare so that every Chinese student with adequate
English foundation can read and understand Shakespeare's original from whatever cheap
paperbacks he could get from the library， with the aid of this dictionary.After a few years
consideration，I have drawn up the following plan：
“A SHAKESPEARE DICTIONARY FOR CHINESE STUDENTS”
lovers of Shakespeare with adequate English foundation， in China.
III. Languages Used： English and Chinese.
IV. Size： Smaller than Schmidt， larger than Onions.
V. Scope of Content：Covering 38 plays， 2 narrative poems and the Sonnets.
VI. Contents of an Item：Head-word-English definition(s) with Chinese translation
Examples from Shakespeare's original with Chinese translation - Supplementary remarks if
necessary.
VII. General Introduction.
IX. Main Sources： Drawn from the abundant fruits of researches outside and in China during the
past centuries(rewritten and simplified so as to be easily understood by Chinese students).
X. Working Process：Vocabulary cards
s- Arranged in alphabetical order -Synthesized
Computerized- Completed MS.
—Published in China.
XI. Working Method：Starting from scratch； working like a marathoner，slowly，incessantly
and determinedly； doing by learning， and learning by doing， combined.
This is a work of compilation on the basis of the researches made by forerunners of past
centuries and by learned scholars of our own time. I shall enumerate all the authorities I have
consulted in a list of acknowledgements in my dictionary.
William Tyndal， the hero of Bible translation， once declared that he “will cause a boy that
driveth the plough shall know more of the scripture”. In compiling my dictionary， I work with a
sincere hope that more and more young scholars， translators and lovers of Shakespeare will arise
among our students in the 21st century， thus raising the studies of Shakespeare to a higher level in
China.
Above-mentioned are the motives， ideas and project of my “Shakespeare Dictionary for
Chinese Students”. Now this English-Chinese Shakespeare dictionary has been published in China
as a handsome volume of 1，283 16mo pages with general introduction，appendices and all. I
think it would be suitable for me to say a few
words about some of the most
t prominent
impressions concerning Shakespeare's language， which have been left in my mind during twelve
years' compilation and publication of my dictionary.
is face to face with an ocean of words used by a cultural giant， totalling 21，000 to 28，000 in
number according to recent estimations. The compiler's work of studying and choosing among
various explanations of each word， and making his decision about its meaning should be carried
on all the year round. A sense of dual responsibility to the Bard on the one hand and to the young
learners on the other lies heavy like a millstone on my back while I work at my desk every day.
The task is unspeakably arduous. But fortunately I can rely on the fruits of researches of those
learned scholars of Britain， America，Germany and other Western countries， who have laboured
for three centuries in their efforts to have “chewed and digested” every word left behind by the
great poet in order to make it rightly understood and pleasurably appreciated by the world's
9
readers and audience.
Among the Shakespeare dictionaries published in late 19th and early 20th centuries the most
authoritative are undoubtedly C. T. Onions’A Shakespearean Glossary and Alexander Schmidt's
Shakespeare-Lexicon . A Shakespearean Glossary was compiled by an editor of The Oxford English
Dictionary. Its original aim“is to supply definitions and illustrations of words or senses of words
now obsolete or surviving only in provincial or archaic use， together with explanations of others
involving allusions not generally familiar，....”The definitions of this world-famous Glossary
are precise， pithy and terse. But，regrettably， its criterion of inclusion of Shakespeare's
vocabulary is too strict for general readers. Schmidt's Shakespeare-Lexicon bears the sub-title“A
Complete Dictionary of All the English Words， Phrases and Constructions in the Works of the
Poet.”He declares in the Preface：
“The
epresent work，as
differing from the existing
Shakespearean glossaries， the object of which has been to explain what has become obsolete and
unintelligible in the writings of the poet， is to contain his whole vocabulary and subject the sense
and use of every word of it to a careful examination.”As a user of the Lexicon， I should say that
old Schmidt is a veritable gold mine of Shakespeare's vocabulary upon which every scholar of
Shakespeare may draw much information. But the first edition of the Lexicon was published in
1875， and its third edition with a supplement of 30 pages by Sarrazin was published in 1901. So it
is impossible for both its editor and reviser to utlize the new results of the studies of Shakespeare's
language made during the 20th century. Although the Lexicon is still very useful， some of its
definitions seem now indistinct， and once in a while you may find no explanation for some
difficult word which should be explained.
An essay of E. V. Lucas's put me in mind of the fact that W. J. Craig (1843-1906)，the
Irish editor of The Oxford Shakespeare and The Arden Shakespeare ， had devoted his lifetime to
compiling a new Shakespeare lexicon instead of old Schmidt， but left it unfinished. (“His own
magnus opus he left unfinished； he had worked at it for years， until to his friends it had come to
be something of a joke. But though still shapeless， it was a great feast， as the world， I hope， will
one day know. If， however， this treasure does not reach the world， it will not be because its
worth was insufficient， but because no one can be found to decipher the manuscript； for I may
say incidentally that our old friend wrote the worst hand in London.”-AFuneral. I hope that
W. J. Craig's manuscript is safely preserved somewhere in Britain.
The completion of The New English Dictionary on Historical Principles in 1928， and that of
The Oxford English Dictionary in 1933， furnished scholars of the world with enormous linguistic
material and enabled them to make new researches into Shakespeare's language. They could now
explain many of those words and phrases of Shakespeare which had long remained unexplained，
t0
with the aid of the great Oxford Dictionary. But the fruits of their harvests have been scattered
here and there in various editions of Shakespeare published during the 20th century. The time
seems ripe for the scholars of the world to compile and publish a new Shakespeare dictionary to
meet the demand of the readers and audience of the 21st century.
Shakespeare mastered a large vocabulary which he used with an unprecedented flexibility
that may never be seen again. Virginia Woolf once mentioned“how many words Shakespeare
used and how much grammar Shakespeare violated”(The Patron and the Crocus). So far as the
violation of grammar is concerned， the first irregularity you will find at a glance of Shakespeare's
text may be the free interchange of the parts of speech. Here is a classical description given by
E. A. Abbott：“In the first place， almost any part of speech can be used as any other part of
speech. An adverb can be used as a verb，‘They askance their eyes’(R. of L.)； as a noun，‘the
noun， adjective， or neuter verb can be used as an active verb. You can ‘happy'your friend，
‘malice’or ‘foot’your enemy， or ‘fall’：
or ‘fall’an axe on his neck. An adjective can be used a
is an
adverb； and you can speak and act ‘easy’，‘free’，‘excellent’： or as a noun， and you can talk of
10
‘the fairest she he has yet beheld.'”(Introduction to A Shakespearian Grammar)
The Elizabethan Age was a period of transition in the history of English language， in which
new-emerging things and ideas called for the invention of new terms of expression. This inspired
writers
sand
poets
with
great
enthusiasm
n for coining
new
words.
Shakespeare and
his
contemporaries enjoyed a linguistic licence which later writers and poets can never enjoy. Vigour
of expression was preferred to rules of grammar， and there was no authoritative grammar or
dictionary to restrict them. So， during the 25 years of his writing career， Shakespeare brought
about a miracle in the history of English language and produced a large number of new coinages
of his own. As a busy actor，playwright， poet and share-holder of a drama troupe， we can
imagine， he had neither the time to compile a glossary for his plays and poems， nor the patience
to define the exact meaning of every word in his works. That is the task of later scholars. And
from the 18th century onward， one generation after another of scholars， since Pope， Johnson
and Malone， have investigated into Shakespeare's text so meticulously that they left no single
word， nay， not even a punctuation mark written by him untouched， so that we may now
understand Shakespeare's
language tolerably well， with the exception of a small number of
“cruxes” over which scholars should still cudgel their brains hereafter.
Shakespeare often used a word in such a way that， basing on its etymological root sense， he
adopted it to various contexts and endowed it with various meanings， thus changing it into a
polysemant.Hence arose a peculiarity in Shakespeare's language， i.e. the interchangeability of
the multifarious significations of a single term. Here is an example in Othello IV. ii. 201：
‘tis foul in her.”The word “foul”may be defined as “dirty”，“shameful”，“wicked”，“criminal”，
and the four definitions are all relevant to the context. Two better known examples are“love”
and “will”in the Sonnets， either of which has four or five significations. Sometimes， there is no
unbridgeable gulf between the different meanings of a word used by Shakespeare. Of crucial
importance is， of course， a careful study of the context.
The copious polysemants provided Shakespeare with plentiful occasions of playing with
words， and Shakespeare was fond of wordplays. The first words of Hamlet，“A little more than
kin， and less than kind”(I. ii. 65)constitute a play on kin (i.e. relation) and kind (i.e.
member of the same family united in natural feeling)，which implies the unnatural relationship
between Claudius and Hamlet. Again， a line in Love's Labour’s Lost，“Light， seeking light， doth
light of light beguile，”according to Harry Levin， plays on the four significations of the word
“light”，which are separately “intellect”，“wisdom”，“eyesight” and“daylight”.
e
Punning is the kind of wordplay profusely used by Shakespeare.“Puns may be homophonic
or semantic.”(N.B.Blake：Shakespeare's Language： An Introduction) A homophonic pun
consists of“two words that agree in sound， while differing in sense.”In Richard the Third
semantic pun indicates a polysemant which has at least two meanings， one of which is sometimes
obscene. There is an example in The Comedy of Errors IV. i. 111：“She is too big， I hope， for
me to compass.”The word“compass” is punning on both the meaning“achieve，obtain” and the
meaning“embrace”.
Malapropism is wordplay extending to the sphere of learned terms easily misunderstood and
mispronounced by less educated but self-asserted people. Dogberry， the self-important constable
of Much Ado About Nothing， in his attempt to command respect， shouts“Dost thou not suspect
my place? Dost thou not suspect my years?”(IV. ii. 71-72) thus mixing up the two opposite
terms and causing a laughable effect on the stage.
It is easy for the compiler of a Shakespeare dictionary to handle Shakespeare's wordplay or
puns. He needs only to arrange the different meanings or words one by one in parallel， and let
the reader to appreciate Shakespeare's wit for himself. But it is much more difficult for a
11
translator to deal with the Bard's quibblings. He may once in a while be able to find two words
with the same sound but different meanings. But in most cases， I am afraid， he could only drop
the attempt because the language he uses in his rendering is quite different from the English
language of Shakespeare.
Harry Levin writes：“In reading and studying Shakespeare， at best we merely approximate
the actual condition of his art.”As the compiler of A Shakespeare Dictionary for Chinese
Students，I have personally experienced the weight of this verdict. After swimming in the ocean
of Shakespeare's language for twelve years， I feel I have only gathered a few seaweeds from his
“multitudinous seas”. But I wish that they might be useful to our students as if they were
“Sesame， open!”before the gate of Shakespeare's golden treasury.

General Introduction
I. William Shakespeare：
Life and Work
The facts of Shakespeare's life come down to
us from three sources： church and legal records，
folk
traditions，
and
the
ecomments
C
his
contemporaries. The church and legal
records
contain a series of dates and facts concerning his
birth，marriage， business transactions and his
death. These give us the merest sketch of his
life， and far from being complete. Of some
value are the traditions that were current among
the old residents of his native town and London，
who knew Shakespeare personally. They serve
to reconstruct some pages of the poet's biography
when written records
are lacking. Meanwhile
plays and poems in the works of his contemporaries
that help us to restore his image and estimate his
influence upon his time.
William Shakespeare was born on April 23，
town
in
His
father，
Shakespeare， was a well-to-do trader in wool，
hides and leathern articles， and once held the
office of chief alderman， equivalent to mayor.
At the age of seven William was sent to the
local grammar school which he attended for six
years. He read widely in the books current in his
day and picked up“small Latin and less Greek”.
When Shakespeare was fourteen， his father
fell into debt， and the boy probably left school
and became a country schoolmaster， to help
support his family.
In 1582 Shakespeare was
r
married to Anne
Hathaway， a farmer's daughter， who was eight
years older than her boy husband. They had
three children： Susanna and the twins， Judith
and Hamnet.
21
There
traditional
saying
that
Shakespeare had
poached on the lands
sof
f
a
certain Sir Thomas Lucy， a rich landlord. But
the poet“was much given to all unluckiness in
stealing venison and rabbits.”He was caught by
Lucy's keepers and severely punished (whipped
and imprisoned，it
was
avenged himself by composing a satirical ballad.
Very soon it became so popular throughout the
countryside that wherever Sir Thomas went he
was met with the strains of the ballad. He was
enraged and redoubled his persecution to such a
degree that Shakespeare was compelled to leave
Stratford and seek refuge in London.
Shakespeare arrived in London in 1586
or
1587.At
t
that
time the drama
S
rapidly
gaining popularity among the people. He was
sai
aid to have kept horses for the gen
gentlemen
outside the play-houses.He must
t
have
gone
through many hardships and undertaken many
jobs
t
before he became
acquaintedwith
heatrical companies. Then he
ecame
an actor of some dramatic troupe， playing minor
parts. He did not seem to have distinguished
himself as an actor； but he must have learned
much of the technique of dramatic art from his
personal experience with the stage.
Shakespeare lived in an age when the old
feudal social and economic order was
being
destroyed and a new capitalist society was being
born and when London took a leading part in
that
destruction and
that
new
birth.
.
The
theatrical companies actively participated in all
t
affairs of London and
by their
performances helped to propagate new ideas.
Whatever foreign country or whatever historic
era the dramatists depicted in their plays，the
audience understood that contemporary England
was
meant.
This
is
a
key
to
the correct
understanding of the Elizabethan plays.
While leading the busy life of an
1
actor，
Shakespeare worked
hard
L
with
his
pen. He
revised old plays and wrote new ones at the rate
of about two a year. In his plays he was always
keenly alive to the events of contemporary life.
This，
together
with
1.
his
rapidly im
improved
craftsmanship， made his plays extremely popular.
There is ample evidence testifying to his great
success. As early as in 1590， Edmund Spenser
22
praised Shakespeare in one of his poems，and
Robert Greene， one of the “university wits”，
91
warned other playwrights， in a letter in 1592， of
the rise and success
SO
of
f“an
upstart crow”，
In 1593
and 1594，Shakespeare published
his two narrative poems Venus and Adonis and
The Rape of Lucrece. His Sonnets， circulating
1609.His genius as a
poet won recognition
from his
In 1598
a
young
scholar，
Francis
N
Meres
(1565

-
1647)，
published Palladis Tamia： Wit's Treasury(A
the Greek ， Latin and Italian Poets). In this he
spoke of Shakespeare as one of the leading
writers of the time and“the most excellent”in
both comedy and tragedy， listing 12 of his plays
and mentioning
his
sonnets
then circulating
privately.
Shakespeare was“a handsome，well-shaped
and pleasant smooth wit
1 wit”. He was
called the
friends. Here is a description of Shakespeare's
character
by
t
the
contemporary
poet
and
dramatist Ben Jonson：
“I
remember，the
e
players
have
often
mentioned it as an honour to Shakespeare，that
in his writing (whatsoever he penned) he never
blotted out a line. My answer hath been，
‘Would he had blotted a thousand!'which they
thought a malevolent speech. I had not told
posterity this， but for their ignorance，who
by， wherein he most faulted； and to justify my
own candour； for I loved the man， and do
honour his memory， on this side idolatry，as
much as any. He was (indeed) honest， and of an
open and free nature； had an excellent fantasy，
he flowed with that facility， that sometimes it
was necessary he should be stopped ... His wit
was in his own power； would the rule of it had
been so too!
Many times he fell into those
things， could not escape laughter：as when he
said in the person of Caesar， one speaking to
him，
‘Caesar，thou dost
t
I
me
e
V
wrong!’H
He
replied，‘Caesar did never wrong but with just
23
cause'， and such like； which were ridiculous.
svirtues.
There was ever more in him to be praised than
to be pardoned.”(Discoveries)
This may serve as a clue to the manner of
writing and the personality of Shakespeare.
As a playwright， he was much beloved by the
actors. In a comedy of the time， The Return
from Parnassus(1600)，one actor says，
，
“Few of
the university pen plays well；” another answers，
“Why， here's our fellow Shakespeare ( who)
puts them all down， ay， and Ben Jonson too.'
99
What
with
t
the
industrious
S
authorship，
continual rehearsals and performances of his
own and other plays， his life must have been
very busy. But somehow， he retired to his native
L
town about 1611， though still in the prime of
life.
.
There
S
seems
to
be
some
connection
between his retirement and the decline of the
stage. After returning to his native town， he
took a great interest in its affairs. But he paid
frequent
visits
to
London
till
1614，
and
continued his relations with actors and poets.
Shakespeare died on April 23， the anniversary
of his birth， in 1
，and
was
S
t
buried
1
i
in
Stratford Church. He bequeathed in his will a
sum of money for rings
s
as souvenirs to “my
fellows， John Herminge， Richard Burbage and
Henry Condell.”In his life-time，Shakespeare
seems to have made no attempt to collect and
publish his plays， or even to save his manuscripts，
which were carelessly left to the stage managers
of the theatres. After his death， two of his
above-mentioned fellow-actors，Herminge and
Condell，collected and published Shakespeare's
plays in 1623. To this edition， which has been
known as the First Folio， Ben Jonson dedicated
a poem in praise of the author：
“... Soul of the Age!
The applause! delight! the wonder of our
stage!
Triumph，my Britain， thou hast one to show
To whom all scenes of Europe homage owe.
He was not of an age， but for all time!”

II.
A Chronological
List of Shakespeare's
38 of Shakespeare's plays have come down to
us. But it is often difficult to date a given play
precisely.Scholars have had to work out the
chronological order of his plays， based on three
kinds
of
evidence，i. e. external evidence
(records of performance and
1
publication，or
references in contemporary
v works)，internal
evidence (allusions in the plays to contemporary
events.
or
quotations
from
L(
contemporary
works)，and
S
stylistic evidence (changes and
developments in
Shakespeare's
use of t
blank
verse， rhyme and prose). By a combination of
the three kinds of evidence， most plays can be
dated approximately and placed in the order of
their writing， so that it is possible
possible to trace
Shakespeare's development as a dramatist. The

III.
Four Periods
of Shakespeare's
III.
Dramatic Composition
(With Synopses of His Plays and Poems)
The settling of the chronological order of
plays
has
s enabled
ischolars
t
to
discern a process of development in his work.
Shakespeare's
career as
a
dramatist may
be
divided into four major phases which represent
respectively his early， mature，flourishing， and
late periods.
The First Period(1590-1594)
The first period of Shakespeare's dramatic
composition is the period of his apprenticeship
in
play-writing，
during
which
he，
as
a
newcomer to London， made experiments in a
number of dramatic forms， including history
plays(Henry VI， Parts I， II and III，Richard
III)，varieties of comedy ( The Comedy of
Errors，The Taming of the Shrew，The
Two
Gentlemen of Verona ，Love's Labour's Lost)，a
revenge tragedy(Titus Andronicus)，and
d
romantic tragedy (Romeo and Juliet). In these
.ae-
years he also wrote two narrative poems，Venus
and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece . All these
laid the foundation for his dramatic career and
literary fame.
When Shakespeare wrote these early plays，he
was a young man from 26 to 30. His work in this
period bears the mark of youth， but of youth
with
astonishing
versatility
and
wonderful
talent. The comedies are chiefly concerned with
the affairs
f
youth
and
full of
romantic
sentiment. They enter into the cares and love-
affairs， the recreations and the studies of the
young people， and the plots often end in every
Jack having his fore-appointed Jill. Even the
tragedy of Romeo ana
Juliet
is
slyrical
and
optimistic in spirit， lit up by the spring and
young
dramatist
hatist tri
ttried to
handle
politicalthemes
a
and
give historical
lessons.
Henry VI is a weak
 but virtuous king without
resource， whose ineptitude brought disaster on
England. Richard III is a strong， resourceful
27
king without virtue， who brought on calamity
through his lust for power and oppression. This
the political questions of his time. This period
also shows Shakespeare to have been a man of
wide reading. He had read Plautus'
comedy，
Plutarch's Lives， Ovid's Metamorphoses，Florio's
Montaigne，
Berner's
Froissart，
9
Holinshed's
Chronicles，Chaucer，Sidney，Marlowe， and the
Bible. All of these authors and books he used in
the composition of his plays. So far as language
concerned，
his
S
early
plays
S
show
an
in the choice of phrases and epithets，
which
distinguished his work from that of any of his
contemporaries.
At first，his
his drama relies not so much
ion
character as on fine or witty speech and situation.
Different types of characters are distinguished
by their different bearing and language，
out
various characters of the same
type are very
little differentiated by the possession of different
intellectual endowments or psychological attributes.
The device of mistaken identity is employed
once and again as the best source of fun (The
of Errors，T
Two Gentlemen
of
Comedy of Errors，
Verona，Love's Labour's Lost). In the history
plays，

accuracy

principle of causing the action to revolve around
one or two central figures
and of
making
character but not incident the source of action，
is
S
gradually followed. If the characters in his
earliest plays lack individualization，Sha
beare
showed an increasing insight into character and
mind， and finally gained a good command of
Romeo
and
and
Richard III.
Shakespeare's
S
plays are poetical dramas. A
great number of important dialogues and soliloquies
in his plays assume the form of poetry. But the
form of poetry used in his earliest plays was not
a happy vehicle for expression.
It consisted，
d the
custom of rhyming made the verse even more
mechanical and unfit for dramatic expression.
The dramatist was bound by the rigidity of line
due to the regularity of rhyme and metre. The
production of Marlowe's Tamburlaine in 1587
28
revealed the tremendous possibilities of blank
verse， i.e. poetry in unrimed iambic pentameter.
And， with the influence of Marlowe， Shakespeare
began to use blank verse as the primary form of
poetry in his
play-writing.
The First Period
shows
a
general
tendency of
the
gradual
diminishing and disappearance of rhyme as the
principal impediment in Shakespeare's dramatic
composition.Once rhyme was dropped in the
line， the poet was more at liberty to express his
own conception of the subject and， under his
hands，
5
blank
verse developed into
a
happy
vehicle to express
S
all kinds of thought and
proportion of rimed lines to blank
K verse may
serve as a test to show the gradual development
of Shakespeare's dramatic art in different periods.
HENRY VI， PARTS I，II AND III
In 1594-1595，appeared in print Shakespeare's
two-part historical play， The Whole Contention
Between the Two Famous Houses，Lancaster and
York
k
(probably
written
n
between
1589
and
(1455-1485)during the reign of King Henry VI
(1422-1461)， who belonged to the House of
Lancaster. Another part about the early years of
Henry
VIwas
published in the
1623
Folio
edition of Shakespeare's plays as the first part
of King
Henry
VI，
and
1
The
Contention
appeared in that collection as the second and
third parts. The three parts of Henry VI deal
with the successive internal conflicts between
the two noble families， York and Lancaster，
for the
the English
throne，
giving
a
1
dramatic
version of English history from the death of
Henry V(1422) to the accession of Edward IV
(1461).
Part I shows the defeat of England by France
in the Hundred Years'War(1338-1453)，the
relief of Orleans by the French and the gradual
expulsion of the English from a large part of
France. The French are guided and inspired by
their heroine Joan of Arc， who， in accordance
with the English bias of the time， is represented
as
a
“minister of hell”
a
wanton.On the
English side，the commander Talbot
WS
other leaders into the shade. At home， the play
shows the beginning and development of the
enmity between York and Lancaster.
IN
2
29
Part II continues
the story of the internal
and
d
I
Lancaster.The vigorous
Margaret of France arrives in England and is
married to Henry VI， while the intrigues of the
Yorkist faction develop until the Duke of York
claims the crown. A caricature of the rising of
Jack Cade against the misrule of Henry VI is
given in the play. Meanwhile begins the Wars of
the Roses.
In Part III the Duke of York is seated in the
throne， and Henry weakly agrees
should succeed him， thus disinheriting his son.
Queen Margaret， enraged， attacks the Yorkists，
captures York and killed him. But Richard the
hunchback，Duke of Gloucester， and Edward，
Earl of March， both sons of York， turns what is
almost a loss into a victory. Henry， after some
twists and
l turns， is thrown into the London
Tower and
murdered by Richard. Edward
1 is
crowned as Edward IV， the first Yorkist king of
England. In the play Shakespeare already shows
himself a master of tragic poetry， notably in the
speech of the captured York (wounded，mocked
by a paper crown on his head， and awaiting
death under the cruel taunts of Queen Margaret)
and
i in the meditation
n of t
the King
on
n
miseries of civil war.
RICHARD III
This historical play， acted probably in 1594
and printed in 1597，continues
S
the story of
Henry VI，Part III，and shows
how Richard
won and lost the crown. It opens in the reign of
Edward

brother.Edward

attempts to induce his nobles to be reconciled.

But Richard， a hunchback and having a withered
arm， is filled with ambition and cold-blooded
cruelty. He diabolically clears all opponents in
his way and seizes the crown amid the curses and
tears of the wives and mothers of those he has
murdered. He has murdered Henry VI， but he
wooes and wins his son's widow. When Edward
30
IV dies， Richard has his two little sons murdered in
the Tower. Meanwhile the English nobles are
deserting him， and Henry， Earl of Richmond，
of the House of Tudor， is coming to England
with his forces.

THE COMEDY OF ERRORS
One of the earliest plays of Shakespeare，
acted in 1594 and printed in 1623. The plot is
taken from a play by the ancient Roman comic
dramatist Plautus， a comedy of confusions between
twin brothers living in the same town， unknown
to each other. But Shakespeare has added twin
servants to twin master-brothers， filling the play
1
quadruple misunderstandings.
The
two
cities， Syracuse and Ephesus， are at enmity. If
any one of either place came to the other， he
should be killed
1
unless he paid
a
1
thousand
marks. Aegeon， an old Syracusan merchant，is
arrested in Ephesus. He explains how he came
there. His wife Aemilia and a poor woman had
boys. In a shipwreck，he，with his younger son
and servant， has been separated from his wife，
with his elder son and servant. Then the younger
son，Antipholus of Syracuse， and the younger
home i
in
search of their brothers. And Aegeon has been
trying to find them for five years. In reality， his
elder son， Antipholus of Ephesus， and the elder
31
servant，Dromio of Ephesus， have all along
been in Ephesus， after being rescued
1
from
shipwreck. And Aemilia， unknown to them， is
there too. Meantime，Antipholus and Dromio of
Syracuse also co
come
e to Ephesus.
. A pair of
Antipholuses and a pair of Dromios happen to
live in the same place on the same day. A series
of amusing misunderstandings occurs. In the end
mistakes are explained and all ends happily.
Though an apprentice work， the play reveals
Shakespeare's mastery of construction.
THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA
An early comedy by Shakespeare，probably
written about 1594 and first printed in 1623. The
plot is a double love affair with complications.
“two gentlemen” are the young friends
Valentine，simple and frank，and
Proteus，
fickle and scheming. Proteus is in love， at first，
with Julia.Valentine leaves Verona for Milan，
and there falls in love with Silvia， the duke of
Milan's daughter. She loves him in return. But

A comedy by Shakespeare and one of his earliest
works， acted about 1595 and printed in 1598.

life in the theatre during the past 50 years， and
scholars discovered that it is full of humanity.

THE TAMING OF THE SHREW
An early comedy by Shakespeare，probably
written 1593-1594 and first published in 1623.
The main plot concerns the successful attempts
of a gentleman to tame into obedience and love
a wilful and shrewish young lady. The scene is
laid in Italy. Baptista， a rich gentleman of Padua，
has
S
two daughters：
：
Bianca
is
gentle，
and
Katharina is fiery in temper. Three suitors want
to marry Bianca， but nobody dares to wed
Katharina，the so-called
1“Kate the Shrew”.
Baptista won't let Bianca marry until Katharina
is cleared off. Petruchio， a gentleman in Verona，
determines to marry Katharina by taming her
33
hand in spite of her rude rebuffs， affecting to
find her courteous and gentle. He keeps her
waiting in the church at wedding， knocks down
the priest， and carries her off， sword in hand.
He puts her on a wretched horse， which tumbles
her in the mud and falls on her. When they get
to the house， he throws away her food and her
new dress， saying they are not good enough for
her. He makes her say that the sun is the moon，
and an old man is a young maiden， just as he
tells her. And when she is regularly tamed， he
takes her back to her father's house. Meantime，
Bianca has been won by young Lucentio， who has
made love to her，masquerading as a schoolmaster.
Hortensio， the disappointed suitor of Bianca，
has married a widow. At the marriage-feast，
Petruchio proves that he has the most affectionate
and
docile wife of the
1
three bridegrooms.
Though this play is sometimes acted as a farce，
it is a comedy of characters with significations
beyond the story of the wooing， wedding， and
taming of a “shrew”by a gentleman.
TITUS ANDRONICUS
A revenge tragedy attributed to Shakespeare，
acted and printed in 1594. The story is a series
of atrocities and horrors. Titus， a Roman general，
returning from the Gothic wars with prisoners，
finds Bassianus and Saturninus， two brothers， in
conflict for the throne. With the help of Titus，
Saturninus is made
made emperor， and would wed
Lavinia， Titus's daughter， but Bassianus carries
her off， and weds her. The prisoners， including
Tamora，
9(
queen of
of the Goths，
，Aaron，her
nto
Saturninus，who weds Tamora.
Titus has granted
one of Tamora's three sons as a sacrifice for his
dead sons， and Tamora seeks revenge. Her two
remaining sons find Bassianus and Lavinia in a
wood： the former they kill；Lavinia-they rape
and mutilate. But Titus's two sons are accused of
s is
deceived that he may save them by cutting off
his hand； Aaron performs this office； but the
sons are killed. Titus's son Lucius goes to join
the Goths and takes revenge on Rome. Tamora
and her sons
g
go disguised to induce Titus to
recall Lucius.
Titus feigns n
not to recognize
them， and persuades Tamora to go and leave her
34
he kills them. Then he recalls Lucius and invites
Tamora and Saturninus to a feast， where he
serves up a pie made of the flesh and blood of
Tamora's sons. General carnage follows. Titus
kills Tamora；Saturninus kills Titus； Lucius kill
Saturninus. At the end， Lucius is proclaimed
emperor. Much doubt has been expressed by
scholars as to whether the play is entirely by
Shakespeare，by Shakespeare in collaboration，
or not by Shakespeare at all.
ROMEO AND JULIET
One of Shakespeare's early masterpieces and
his first romantic tragedy， probably written in
1594. A very bad text of the play appeared in
1597，but a better version of it was published in
1599. In Verona， the Capulets and the Montagues
S
at bitter enmity. Wh
.When old
Capulet
gives
a
feast，Romeo， son of old
Montague， goes to it with his friends. There he
sees Juliet， daughter of old Capulet， and falls in
love with her. Leaping at night over Capulet's
orchard wall， Romeo overhears Juliet's confession
of her love for him， and the young lovers agree
on a secret marriage. With the help of Friar
Laurence， they are wedded. But the next day，
Romeo kills
Tybalt，a Capulet，in
a
a
street
quarrel， and is sentenced to banishment. So he
must leave Verona for Mantua. Old Capulet， in
ignorance of his daughter's
S
secret marriage，
proposes to marry Juliet off to a young nobleman，
Paris. To enable her to escape from this marriage，
Laurence gives her a sleeping potion. Taking it，
she falls
s into a
profound sleep. Her parents
consider her dead and place her in the family
burial vault. Laurence sends off a messenger to tell
Romeo to come and steal Juliet away. However，
by an accident the message is not sent， and
Romeo hears only of her death. He buys poison
and returns to Verona.
.After a
last kiss
on
Juliet's lips， he drinks the poison and dies. Then
Juliet awakes. Finding her lover dead by her
side， she stabs herself with Romeo's dagger.
Though a tragedy， there is no tinge of pessimism
in the play. It is a song of youth and true love，
35
full of poetry and romance. It made a strong
impression on Elizabethan
2
audiences
2
and
iwas
Shakespeare's earliest great success in tragedy.
The balcony scene (2.2) and the parting scene
(3.5) are two great love scenes in the world's
literature.
VENUS AND ADONIS
Venus and Adonis
sis
a
narrative poem in
six-lined
stanzas，
in1593.
It
was
Shakespeare's first published work. The story is
taken
from
Ovid's
Metamorphoses.
Venus
(Aphrodite)，the goddess of beauty and love， is
in love with the beautiful youth Adonis. She
detains him from the chase through woods and
makes efforts to win his love. She begs him to
meet her on the morrow， but he is then to hunt
the boar and flees from her. When the morning
to look for him， finds him killed by the boar.
Ve
US，S
stricken with grief， changes his
s his blood
into the anemone， or wind-flower. The poem is
full of vivid images of the countryside，and
aphorisms on life， which contrast with sensuous
love scenes. It is a young man's work， showing
the
slove
ea
and
knowledge of
nature，
command of
1
fine sense of their
music. It was the most popular of Shakespeare's
writings with the reading public of his time and
impressed them with his poetic genius. Seven
editions of Venus and Adonis had appeared by
1612， and sixteen by 1640.
THE RAPE OF LUCRECE
The Rape of Lucrece，another narrative poem
by Shakespeare， was published in 1594. It is a
66
graver
labour”
and
the
subject
t
tragic，
concerned with the ravishing of Lucrece by
Sextus. Lucrece， a Roman lady of outstanding
virtue and beauty， was the wife of Collatine.
But Sextus， the son of Tarquin， King of Rome，
tried to seduce her， and when she resisted，
committed rape upon her. She told her father
and husband of the outrage， and exacted an oath
of vengeance from them， after which she killed
herself. In consequence，a relative of her husband
led a rebellion against the Tarquin monarchy
and expelled them from the city. Lucrece was
thus traditionally the occasion for the foundation of
1
36
the ancient Roman Republic. The poem，in
seven-lined
1stanzas，
is
S
more rhetoricaland
elaborate than
than Venus and Adonis and，
and，together
with the latter， shows Shakespeare's virtuosity
as a poet. It was popular， too， with the readers
of the time and went through eight editions by
1640.
.
Its
disquisitions
upon
night，time，
opportunity，and lust anticipate brilliant speeches
on general themes in Shakespeare's plays -on
mercy in The Merchant of Venice， suicide in
Hamlet，and“degree” in Troilus and Cressida.
The Second Period(1595-1600)
The second period of Shakespeare's work
1
is
his mature period， mainly a period of“great
comedies”
99
and
d
I
mature
historical
plays.
It
includes 6 comedies ( A Midsummer Night's
Dream ，The Merchant of Venice，The Merry
Wives of Windsor，Much Ado About Nothing，
As You Like It，Twelfth Night)，5 historical
plays (Richard II，Henry IV， Parts I and II，
Henry V，King John)， and a Roman tragedy
(Julius Caesar). His“Sonnets”are also thought
to be written in this period.
The dramatist made an advance in every way
on the basis of the achievements of the first
period， in knowledge， in wisdom， in political
insight， in dramatic skill， in creative power， in
characterization，
and
in versification.
The
comedies of this period are redolent of the pure
breath of the green fields and of flowers， and lit
by a warm sunshine of gladness， ringing with a
chorus of youthful laughter. The general spirit is
optimism.Meantime， the reverse creeps in for
contrast：clouds come over the sun； there is
sorrow， there is pathos， and there is sin； the
innocent may suffer， the guilty may go unpunished
for a time， and even find
good fortune；
3
but
virtue，nevertheless，shall have its reward
triumph in the end， and the wi
wrong sh
all
historical plays of this period， different phases
of English life are shown before us： kings and
princes，
and
d
courtiers，
t
the
rich
adventures of rogues and cheats. As a whole，
this period is Shakespeare's sweet and joyful
time， in which he succeeds in portraying a
magnificent panorama of the manifold pursuits
37
of people in real life.
There is a great lift in characterization，which
distinguishes this second period from the first.
Most notable is
sa
gallery of heroines of the
comedies， who are depicted with ungrudging and
unreserved affection and warmth.Shakespeare
wit， courage， determination， and resourcefulness
in emergency.
-1
Though there are moments of
weariness
and
frailty，their courage 1
never
fails them in time of danger. And with every
pang of affection and anxiety they only grow
stronger and more capable of coping with the
situation. The heroines of Shakespeare's great
comedies，
Portia，
Rosalind，
Viola，
and
Beatrice， are the daughters of the Renaissance，
99
whose images and stories will remain a legacy to
readers and audiences of all time. Naturally，
“there are no heroes but heroines in Shakespeare's
comedies.”
Many
yu
unforgettable
characters
also
pass
before us in the historical plays. There is Henry
IV，strong-willed and able， having a
2.
guilty
conscience and failing in health， not a little
disturbed about the past， but more fearful for
the future； Prince Hal， later Henry V， a prodigal
son and his father's daily sorrow in his youth，
yet cold-headed and always keeping an eye on
current politics， and springing into a new life on
duty's call；Hotspur， the young rebel leader，
brave but rash， impetuous and undiplomatic，
thus going to his doom； and Sir John Falstaff，
knight，
villain，soldier，robber，cheat
and
wit - all combined in one， thus forming one of
Shakespeare's
most
brilliant
creations.
In
writing his early historical plays， Shakespeare
learned
r
much
from
and
other
playwrights of his time， but now he surpassed
them all in expressing the patriotic feelings of
the English people
a
and
their
demand
for
national unity with great force and vividness in
his mature historical plays.
The sources he employed in this period are
many and diversified. He read old plays and
chronicles
sby Holinshed and
1
Hall，and
i
used
them in his historical plays. He had also read
Spenser's
Faerie Queene，Lodge's
Rosalynde，
Ariosto's Orlando，French and Italian novels
and romances， for his comedies.
38
The first period made Shakespeare famous，
but it is in the second period that Shakespeare's
position was
secured

A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM
A comedy by Shakespeare， written about 1593
and printed in 1600. The title shows the quality
of its contents， resembling a dream on midsummer
night， when fantastic dreams were supposed to
0
be commonly dreamt. The background
ie
court of King Theseus of Athens， and the plot is
a beautiful fairy-tale combined with the story of
the struggle for happiness of two pairs of lovers：
Hermia and Lysander，Helena and Demetrius.
Hermia， ordered by her father to marry Demetrius，
refuses，because she loves
1
Lysander，while
Demetrius has formerly professed love for her
friend Helena. Hermia and Lysander agree to
leave Athens and meet in a wood. But Demetrius
follows Hermia， and Helena Demetrius， so that
all four are that night in the wood. This wood is
the
haunt of
fairies. Oberon， king of t
the
fairies，
overhearing
the
quarrel
between
Demetrius and Helena and desirous to reconcile
them，orders Puck， a mischievous
S
sprite，to
drop some love-juice into the eyes of Demetrius，
to make him love Helena
a
again.
But Puck
unluckily drops it into Lysander's eyes， making
him confess love to Helena. When Puck applies
the juice again， both Demetrius and Lysander
make love to Helena. This leads to
o a qu
juarrei
between the two girls and to an attempted duel
between their two lovers. At last， Oberon sets
the matter right， and they return to their former
Subplots concern the quarrel between
Oberon and his queen Titania over a
page-boy
and their final reconciliation and comic scenes
of six English artisans：Bottom
the
er，
Quince the carpenter， Snug the joiner， Flute the
bellows-mender，
Snout
the
tinker，
Starveling the tailor. The play， full of delightful
fancy and fun， ends with happy nuptials. It is
the most lyrical of all Shakespeare's plays， in
which
ements of
Greek
mythology
are
fancifully combined with those of British folk-
lore.
39
A comedy by Shakespeare， probably written
about 1596 and printed in 1600. The story is
Italian in origin. A moneyless young Venetian，
Bas

preparations
tocourt

and appeals to his friend Antonio， a
merchant of Venice， for help. But Antonio's
money is invested in ships at sea.
To aid
Bassanio in his courtship， he borrows money
from Shylock， the Jewish usurer. Shylock， who
has
been
1
insulted
by
Antonio
and
i other
Christians，
agrees to lend the money on the
condition that， if the loan is not paid in three
months， he may cut a pound of flesh from
Antonio's body. With this money， Bassanio goes
and
is

doesn't return on time and he cannot pay the
money. Shylock demands his pound of flesh.
The case is brought before the court. Antonio is
in danger. At the critical moment， a
a
young
doctor of law arrives at the court. He appeals to
the Jew for mercy in a moving speech， but in
vain. Then the doctor admits the validity of
Shylock's claim， but warns him， under pain of
death， that he must fulfil the very letter of his
bond， taking no more and no less than one
pound of flesh， and spilling no drop of blood.
Seeing himself thus cornered， the Jew has no
choice but to obey the verdict of the court. The
young doctor of law who saves the life of
Antonio is no other than Portia in disguise! The
play ends in a moonlight scene at Belmonte， in
which
Portia
reveals
her identity， to the
pleasant
surprise
rise of
her h
husband
Bassanio.
Portia is one of Shakespeare's ideal women
beautiful，cultured，courteous
ous and capable of
rising to an emergency. Meanwhile， the image
of Shylock is also very powerful. Besides being
an avaricious money-lender， he is a Jew of pride
and deep religious
igious instincts. He has suffered
much
h
in the
hands
s of

His
revolting bond is counterbalanced by Antonio's
arrogant treatment of him. So his loud protest
against racial discrimination cannot be altogether
ignored by the audience.

THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR
Tradition has it that Queen Elizabeth I was so
amused by Sir John Falstaff in Henry IV that she
ordered Shakespeare
et
to write
another play
about him， and so Shakespeare wrote The Merry
Wives of Windsor， a comedy probably written
1600-1601 and first printed in 1602.
Falstaff，who is“out at heels”， pretends to be
in love with the wives of two Windsor townsmen，
Mrs. Ford and Mrs. Page， because they have
the rule of their husbands'purses. Each gets a
love-letter from Falstaff， declaring that he loves
her only. When Mrs. Ford shows Mrs. Page her
letter， the latter also shows hers， and they find
both to be the same. They resolve to play him a
trick. So Mrs. Ford invites Falstaff to her house
the next morning.
When Falstaffis
in the
house， Mrs. Page rushes in and declares Mr.
Ford is coming； so they huddle Falstaff into a
clothes-basket， cover him up with dirty clothes，
and their men carry him to the Thames， and
throw him into the river. Then Mrs. Ford gets
him to visit her again. When her husband is
as
a
a fat woman， and Mr. Ford thrashes him
soundly with his stick. The wives explain their
fun to Mr. Ford； and then both husbands and
wives play Falstaff a third trick： they put a
children dressed as fairies to pinch him and burn
him. At last Falstaff confesses that he has been
made an ass.
An amusing underplot turns on Page's daughter，
sweet
t
Anne，of seventeen，
who has
S
three
suitors， among whom she loves only the young
spendthrift Fenton. Taking advantage of the
Fairies scene in the park， Anne goes off with
Fenton and weds him， while the other two
suitors carry off two boys in girls' clothes instead
of Anne.
The play is full of fun， and so is
sometimes called a farce.

RICHARD II
This play， acted about 1595 and printed in
1597，is
the first of the second historical
tetralogy by Shakespeare， the other three being
Henry IV，Part I and Part II， and Henry V.
Richard II， the last King of England of the
direct line in the House of Plantagenet(Anjou)，is
depicted as a king whose capriciousnes
and
incapacity to rule makes his reign a period of
disorder. The main plot is about his relationship
with his cousin Henry Bolingbroke， son of John
of Gaunt， Duke of
f
Lancaster.
Richard，
surrounded by flatterers and intriguers， is afraid of
Henry's power and courting of the people. He
arbitrarily drives Henry into exile and， on the
death of John of Gaunt， unlawfully confiscates
Henry's land. The king， possessed of money，
leaves for an expedition to Ireland. Meantime，
Henry gathers force abroad and returns to England
to defend his right. Noble lords， disgusted with
Richard， join him. Richard，returning

the lesson that to rule wisely is to rule well. The
dying Gaunt delivers to Richard a beautiful，
wise and patriotic speech. The same national
feeling echoes
again in Shakespeare's
later
historical plays.
HENRY IV， PARTS I AND II
A historical play in two parts， acted about
Part II in 1600. Though the play bears his
name， Henry IV is often in the background. The
44
stage is chiefly dominated by his son， Prince
1
Hal (later Henry V) and by Sir John Falstaff.
The secondary characters are numerous， varying
from prostitutes to country
gentlemen and a
Lord Chief Justice.
The subject of Part I is the rebellion of the
Percy family and its defeat. The king is grieved
first by the opposition of some nobles led by the
Percys，notably Harry Hotspur， son of the
Duke of Northumberland，and secondly by the
dissolute conduct of his own son， Prince Hal，
who leads a riotous life with the old ruffian Sir
John
L
Falstaff
and his
S
fellow-rogues
in the
“Boar's Head”tavern in London. One of their
adventures is the famous robbery at Gadshill.
The prince contrives that Falstaff shall rob the
travellers at Gadshill and be robbed in his turn
by the prince himself.
The story leads
to
Falstaff's fabrication to explain the loss of the
booty， and his exposure. Meantime， the revolted
leaders meet to divide up England before they
have won it. The king summons the prince in
this emergency， to remonstrate with him about
his ill conducts. Prince Hal promises better things，
while getting Falstaff a charge of infantry. The
king's forces march against the rebels. Prince
Hal meets Hotspur and kills him at the battle of
enemy attacks him， and claims to have killed
Hotspur after Hal had left him fallen. The king is
attacked， but saved. The royal army is triumphant，
and rebellion is quelled. The first part of Henry
IV is a mixture of richest Shakespearian comedy
with the finest Shakespearian history. It is full
of splendid figures，perfectly drawn， and the
most unforgettable personage is Falstaff， whose
characterization is wholly original. The play
gives us the full blast of Shakespeare's genius in
his maturity.
The second part continues the story， but in it
the mood is grimmer than that of the first part，
humour is less gay， and laughter dies.
After
with Falstaff， and the Lord Chief Justice has to
send the Prince himself to
prison for riot.
Meanwhile the rebels are still in league against
the king， though Hotspur is dead.
John of
Lancaster，another son of the king， has them
45
stratagem，thus suppressing the rebellion. The
king is ill in London，worried over the fate of
England， shortly to be left to his dissolute Hal.
He awakes one day to find the crown stolen
from his pillow. Hal has taken it. The dying
king admonishes his repentent son in loving
words， and gives him counsel for his
re
duties.Then news comes to Falstaff that the
king is dead and Prince Hal is the new king. All
things are his! He hurries to London， but is
unexpectedly banished by his old friend Hal，
now King Henry V， and thrown into prison，
crushed. Falstaff is one of the most unforgettable
characters created by Shakespeare.
HENRYV
A historical play by Shakespeare， acted in
1599 and printed in 1600. In Henry V， the new
king is shown in peace and war， mainly through
his victory over the French at the Battle of
Agincourt. The patriotic feeling which we saw
in the earlier histories rises to its greatest pitch
in this play. With his accession to the throne，
Henry becomes another man：
“The breath no
0
sooner left his father's body， / But that his
advice， Henry V makes war with France in order
to prevent his nobles from making trouble. But
before the war， he sees to it that everything goes
well at home. He crushes a conspiracy of some
noble lords
sto assassinate him and
puts t
the
traitors
S
t
to
death.
On
the
battlefield
of
Agincourt，Henry is depicted as a patriotic king
and a brilliant commander. He walks disguised
among his soldiers， then weary and spent， and
prays for victory. His speeches inspire his troops
with courage and brotherhood. The battle ends
with
great
t
V
victory for England. Before the
conclusion，Henry
woos the French
h Princess
Katharine and wins her. The play ends with
peace between England and France. But the
chorus reminds the audience that England is to
be plunged into civil war during the reign of
Henry V 's son， Henry VI.
Henry V is the last play of Shakespeare's
second historical tetralogy. The two tetralogies，
together with a much later play， Henry VIII，
dramatize two centuries of English history from
255
46
Richard II(1377-1399) to Henry VIII (1509-
1547). They show the horrors of civil war， the
necessity for national unity， the responsibilities
of an efficient ruler， and the importance of
legitimate succession to the throne. These
ideas were of vital interest to Shakespeare's
contemporaries.
KING JOHN
A historical play by Shakespeare，adapted
from an earlier work， The Troublesome Reign of
King John， and written before 1598， but not
with various events in King John's reign (1199-
1216). John provides the central focus of the
play，but Shakespeare depicts him as a ruler
with an unsteady mind in a rapidly changing
course of events.
. The unrest of John's reign
arises from his having usurped the throne from
his nephew Prince Arthur， son of Richard I
(1189-1199)，whose cause is taken up by the
king of France， the English nobles and Church.
Battle follows between France and England，
which ends with the triumph of England and the
capture of Arthur. John instigates Hubert，the
gaoler， to kill Arthur， but Hubert spares his
life. Arthur later dies from a fall in an attempt
to escape from the prison. The nobles join the
French side in anger against the king's treachery.
But fortune is against France， and the French
army withdraws while John， the coward， dies at
Swinstead Abbey. The
e grief of Constance，
Arthur's mother， is forcibly depicted， and the
wit and humour of Philip Faulconbridge enliven
the somewhat flat background of the rest of the
characters.
Shakespeare
(
does
not
mention
Magna Carta， i. e. the Great Charter， which the
English nobles and Church compelled John to
accept，because it became important only during
the 17th-century quarrels between English kings
and parliaments. Since then， Magna Carta has
been regarded as the foundation of constitutional
liberties for English subjects.

and printed in 1623.
.The plot

Plutarch's
S
Lives of the Noble Grecians
and
Romans(1579). The play opens with Caesar's
triumph after a campaign in Spain in the year 44
B. C. People throng the street，rejoicing. But
Caesar's glory is not wholly welcome. The man
is too powerful，too ambitious. He is already
endowed with the dictatorship. After returning
to Rome， he is thrice offered crown， which he
secretly wants， and which he thrice refuses amid
acclamations.
He
acts
before
e
t
the
people，
swooning theatrically. A conspiracy against him
is
brewing among Roman lovers of freedom，
notably Cassius and Casca.
They win over the
noble Brutus，Caesar's
greatest
st
f
friend，who
reluctantly joins their cause from his disinterested
love of the Roman Republic. So Caesar
r
is
assassinated in the senate-house.Cassius would
slay Antony， too， who loves Caesar， but Brutus
decides otherwise. And Antony makes a speech
after Brutus， treacherously but most successfully
inflames the Roman mob

Cassius， and drives them out of Rome.
Then
Octavius，Caesar's nephew， arrives in Rome.
Brutus and Cassius pitch their camp near Sardis.
Antony

march
against
t
them.
Caesar，even after death，still influences the
play. His ghost often appears to Brutus. During
the battle，Cassius is killed.Brutus falls on his
own sword. Octavius is triumphant. The finest
character in the play is Brutus， whose nobility
wins all to him. The two speeches made after
Caesar's death， one by Brutus and the other by
THE SONNETS
another rhyme scheme， a form much in vogue in
Renaissance Europe， especially in Italy， France
and England. In 1609 appeared“Shakespeare's
Sonnets.
Never before Imprinted，”
V
with
a
mys
sterious dedication by Thomas Thorpe， the
publisher，“To the only begetter of these ensuing
sonnets Mr. W.H.”Much speculation centres
on what is meant by“begetter”(i.e. getter or
procurer of the manuscript， or inspirer of the
poems)， and who is meant by“W.H.”.Though
printed in a collection in 1609， these sonnets are
commonly thought to be written between 1593
and 1599. There are 154 sonnets， which may be
e
48
roughly divided into three groups. Numbers 1-17
are variations on one theme. A handsome young
han is being persuaded
I to marry and beget
offspring who will preserve his beauty in a new
generation，though he himself will lose it as he
grows old. Gradually this theme gives place to
the idea that the beloved youth will survive
through the poet's verse. Numbers 18-126 are
on a variety of themes associated with a handsome
man
( who is
presumably，but
not
necessarily， the youth of 1 to 17). The poet
enjoys his friendship and is full of admiration，
promising to bestow immortality on the young
man by the poems he writes in his honour. But
sometimes the young man seems cold. Sometimes he
provokes jealousy by his admiration of another
poet. The climax of the series comes when the
young man seduces the
poet's
smistress.
But
eventually the
poet reconciles himself to the
situation and realizes that his love for his friend
is greater than his desire to keep the woman.
Then begins a new series， principally about a
married woman with dark hair and complexion，
the so-called
i“dark
lady
of the sonnets”，
by whom the poet is enthralled，though
well
aware of her faults. At one point， she is stolen
from him by his best friend. This faithlessness
of both friend and woman wounds the poet
deeply. He nevertheless tries to rise above his
disappointment. Efforts
have been made
e
to
ascertain
n
t
the
identity of these
echaracters，
though no conclusion can be reached to clear up
the mystery. And the “story”in the poems is
merely an elusive one： at times it can be sensed，
2
but frequently breaks off， and then reverts to
the beginning. For all that all critics unite in
praising these sonnets for a variety of virtues.
They express strong feeling. They have a density
of thought and imagery that makes them seem
the quintessence of the poetical experience.
They delight by a felicity of phrase and verse
movement. They also afford the readers hints of
Shakespeare's
I
personality and
personal
I
life，
which， though regrettably scanty and elusive，
are tantalizing.
A Lover's Complaint ，a 329-line poem，was
printed at the end of the Sonnets，in 1609.
Shakespeare's The Phoenix and the Turtle ， a 67-
line poem， appeared in 1601.

The Third Period(1601-1607)
The third period of Shakespeare's dramatic
career is mainly the period of“great tragedies”
and“dark comedies”. It includes 5 tragedies
(Hamlet，Othello，King Lear，Macbeth，Timon
of Athens)，3 comedies ( Troilus and Cressida，
All's Well That Ends Well，Measure for Measure)，
and 2 Roman tragedies (Antony and Cleopatra，

note is aggravated. The sunshi
e
and
laughter of the second period has turned into
clouds and storms. The cause of such a change
should be sought from Shakespeare's change of
moods as influenced by the social upheavals at
the turn of the century. About 1600，England
was

The Crown

against the Queen's policies and royal privileges.
There were plots against Elizabeth. In 1602 the
Earl of Essex， a former favourite of Elizabeth，
started a rising， which cost him his head. There
rose the undermasters in London， who were
being converted into wage-labourers. In 1604，
the Earl of Southampton，Shakespeare's patron，
was arrested by James I， the new
king， on
charges of treason. It was amid this atmosphere
unrest
that Shakespeare wrote his
“great tragedies” and“dark comedies”， in which
complicated social contradictions are mercilessly
exposed.

this

third

represents! There are scenes of murder，lust，
treachery，ingratitude and crime. In Hamlet we
see the bright and happy life of the young prince
darkened by the lust and ingratitude of his
mother and by the revelation of his uncle's foul
murder of his father， and， after long hesitations
and suspences， the Danish
Danish prince in his

death carries out the task of revenge， while the
pure， weak Ophelia shares the same fate with
him. In Othello， we are allowed for a short
Moor's winning， wooing， and wedding his beautiful
bride. But the treacherous， trusted friend，“honest
Iago”， the devil in man's shape， is soon at work，
and finally the innocent Desdemona lies stifled on
her bridle bed by her husband. In Macbeth，the
traitor-couple murder their king and friend， driven
by ambition. But joy， calm， sleep， all leave them.

“All the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten

death. By their side stand Edmund， a second

Every one is mean， every one acts from low
motives. Cressida， a beautiful girl in Chaucer's
poem， is debased into a mere wanton. In All's
Well That Ends Well we have Bertram，blood-
whose nauseating personality is felt throughout
the play， while the noble-natured Helena has to
win Bertram in marriage by a trick. In Measure

way you have sinned， in the same shall you be
punished；atonement you shall make， not shirk.

HAMLET
A
tragedy by Shakespeare，
，
V
written about
1601，published imperfectly in 1603， and fully
in 1604. The story comes from an ancient legend
of North Europe， which had been made into a
play of revenge by some English writer. But
Shakespeare's handling of the subject has turned
it into a great tragedy of a modern thinker. The
51
action of the play is laid in Denmark. Gertrude，
Oueen of Denmark，widowed l
by the sudden
death of the King， within two months marries
the late king's
brother Claudius，
who thus
becomes the new King. Prince Hamlet， son of
the late king， returns home from the University
of Wittenberg. He suspects foul play on the part
of Claudius， his uncle. Then his father's ghost
appears to him at the castle of Elsinor，and
confirms Hamlet's suspicion. He undertakes to

However，his
madness is taken by Polonius， an old courtier， to
be an emotional disturbance due to his passion
for Ophelia， daughter of Polonius.
Att
this
moment， a company of players visits the castle，
and Hamlet has a play acted， which resembles
the late king's
s murder. The guilty Claudius
starts up in fear before the play ends， and goes
out.Gertrude sends Hamlet to her chamber，
where he reveals Claudius'baseness and expresses
his indignation at her hasty marriage，
renders the queen heart-broken.
.
Then Hamlet
becomes aware that he is being overheard in the
conversation. Thinking it is Claudius that is in
hiding， he runs his sword through the arras but
finds the eavesdropper thus killed to be Polonius.
The king now determines to destroy Hamlet. He
sends Hamlet to England， intending to have him
killed there. But pirates capture Ham

send him back to Denmark again. Heart-broken
at the death of her father， poor Ophelia goes

OTHELLO
A tragedy by Shakespeare， acted in 1604 and
printed in 1622. In Othello we turn to Venice，
the city of
canals，and
to Cyprus
s in the
Mediterranean.
Othello，a
a
S
splendid Moorish
general in the service of Venice， has wedded
Desdemona，the daughter of Senator Brabantio，
she discerning the noble qualities beneath his
dark skin， and loving him for his manhood and
the dangers
passed through.
.Iago，
Othello's ensign and a cynical hater of other
people's happiness，tells
S
Brabantio，in dirty
WO
ds， his daughter's flight. In the Senat
nate，
Brabantio accuses Othello of kidnapping his
daughter with spells and witchcraft. Othello in
plain， noble words tells the story of his love，
and Desdemona tells how she fell in love with
the Moor.
Brabantio
professes resignation.
Then Othello and his wife set off for Cyprus.
Iago goes too， with Roderigo， the foolish suitor
of Desdemona， and Cassio the Moor's lieutenant.
Othello and Desdemona live happily together.
But Iago， harbouring a secret resentment against
Othello because he has promoted Cassio over his
head，
.weaves
a
(
devilish
plot to

V
wreck
the
happiness of Othello. He instigates a quarrel
between Cassio and Roderigo， resulting in the
dismissal of Cassio by Othello. Then he arranges
that Cassio shall meet Desdemona，entreating
her to plead for him， and brings Othello by at
the time， thus arousing Othello's suspicions.
This is only the beginning of a series of foul lies
which convince Othello that he is wronged.
Then Iago manages to get from his wife Emilia，
Desdemona's maid， a handkerchief belonging to
De
mona， and swears to
to Othello that she
Desdemona pleads for Cassio， Othello demands
the handkerchief. It is missing. His suspicion is
confirmed. Then Iago makes Cassio chat about
his mistress Bianca， and Othello overhears their
chatting，thinking that Cassio is speaking of
Desdemona. Othello is now assured. He strikes
his fair wife in public， and then， in her bed-
chamber， strangles her in spite of her pleading.
Emilia， learning the crime， tells the true story
53
of
the
e
handkerchief.
Othello
realizes
S
his
monstrous mistake， runs at Iago， wounds him，
and then kills himself. Iago is
 punished， and
Cassio is made governor of Cyprus.

tragedies.
KING LEAR
One of Shakespeare's great tragedies， acted in
1606 and first printed in 1608. The main plot is
S
based on an old British legend. Lear， king of
Britain and a self-willed old man， intends to
give up government of state affairs， and divides
his realm among his three daughters： Goneril，
Regan and Cordelia. He asks them who loves
him most. Goneril and Regan win his trust by
fine words， and each receives one-third of the
kingdom. Cordelia， disgusted with their flattery，
says she loves him according to her duty， not
more nor less. Her tactless honesty enrages her
father， who gives her nothing， dividing her
portion
1 between his other daughters.
.Lear，
retaining only the title of King and a hundred
knights to serve him， begins to live with his two
elder daughters by turns. Soon
he
s
into
cont
act w
with the real nature of Gor
an
Regan，
an， who grudge him
the mantenance，
him， and finally turn him out of doors in a
storm.Old Lear t
becomes
mad.
.
In all l
his
miseries， he has been accompanied only by the
loyal earl of Kent in disguise and a court jester，
who gives him loving and bitter jests on his folly
all along. His youngest daughter，Cordelia， who
has been married to the King of France， comes
back with an army in aid of her father， but is
defeated and taken prisoner with Lear. The play
ends with the tragic scene， in which the poor old
king with his dead Cordelia in his arms，heart-
broken. Then he dies， too. King Lear has a
subplot， the story of the fortunes of Gloucester，
another father suffering from filial ingratitude
and from his false judgement of the characters
of his
children. The main plot and the subplot
are interwoven with each other in the play.
MACBETH
One of Shakespeare's great tragedies， probably
written in 1606 and first printed in 1623. The
story is

based on Holinshed's Chronicle
eo
Scottish History.Macbeth is a powerful general o

1
that
Macbeth shall be thane (lord) of Cawdor and
king hereafter. Immediately afterwards comes
the news that Duncan， King of Scotland，has
made Macbeth thane of Cawdor. The first of the
prophecies is fulfilled. Ambition stimulates him to
aspire to higher things. His wife， Lady Macbeth，
also an ambitious person， helps him to take the
further steps. Duncan pays a visit to Macbeth
and rests
s with him in his castle that night.
Nerved by his wife， Macbeth murders Duncan
and becomes himself King of Scotland. Banquo
suspects him， and he has Banquo assassinated.
To maintain his power， Macbeth commits one
atrocity after another. His reign is a chain of
in mental torture. When he gives a feast， Banquo's
ghost sits in the king's chair， and the feast is

Fife； that none born of woman shall harm him，
and that he never will be conquered till Birnam
Wood shall move to Dunsinane. Learning that
Macduff has joined an opposing army in England
led by Malcolm， son of Duncan， Macbeth causes
his wife and children to be murdered. Meanwhile，
Lady Macbeth has lost her reason. She is afraid

to have been prematurely born， kills Macbeth，
thus fulfilling all the prophecies.Malcolm is
hailed King of Scotland. The play is a tragedy of
ambition，which drives
S
a
brave soldier and
national hero to degenerate into a bloody murderer

and despot right to his doom.
TIMON OF ATHENS
A tragedy by Shakespeare，
written
1
about
1607，probably an unrevised draft，and not
printed until 1623 in the First Folio. The play
ancient Greece， who turns
from a
generous
philanthropist
1
into
2
a
L
misanthropist
through
disillusionment at men's ingratitude. Timon， a
wealthy nobleman of Athens， delights in the
prodigal entertainment of guests， and lavishes
his money on friends， flatterers and parasites.
His land is sold； his debt increases. In spite of
his
S
great
wealth，he soon
finds
himself
f
difficulties. He appeals to his friends， but all
refuse to help him. He then invites them once
more to a feast. The feast is served in covered
dishes.
.
When the covers
are removed，the
dishes are full of hot water，which Timon with
imprecations throws
S
at
his
guests.
Then
L
ne
leaves the city， cursing mankind. He leads
solitary life in the wilderness. While digging for
roots in the woods， he finds a hoard of gold，
which has now no value for him. There he is
visited by Alcibiades， an exiled general， who is
rebelling against the Athenian government，by
Apenmantus， a cynical philosopher， by a poet
and painter， greedy for gold， and by Flavius，
his faithful steward. To all he gives gold， and to
all， except Flavius， he curses. This part of the
play may be called a series of interviews between
Timon and
his
\
visitors，
seemingly
y
2
arranged
solely to bring them under his curses. Eventually
Timon rages
to death，leaving
an
epitaph on his tomb， which expresses his hatred
of mankind. This play is very probably a rough
draft of Shakespeare's. In that case， it presents
an opportunity to look into Shakespeare's working
method of first going straight ahead in drafting
the structure of a play， writing speeches quickly，
and paying little attention to verse form and to
the characterization of minor personages
—all
to be worked up later.
TROILUS AND CRESSIDA
A play by Shakespeare，written about 1601-
1602 and printed in 1609. Its story is based on
Chaucer's narrative poem Troylus and Cryseyde
56
and
d
6
epic Iliad. Like Measure for
Measure ， it is a story of lust. Troilus， a good
soldier of Troy， loves Cressida， a giddy girl，
whose despicable uncle Pandarus goes between
them and inflames one for the other.Cressida，
love. Meanwhile Cressida's father has deserted
4
Troy for the Greek camp. In an exchange of
prisoners，Cressida
is
handed over
to
Dt
the
Greeks. She and Troilus part， with many oaths
of fidelity，but she quickly becomes the mistress
of Diomed， a Greek soldier. During a truce，
Troilus sees her in Diomed's arms， and so is
Pandarus.
The
play
presents many characters of Homer's Iliad and
fighting scenes of the Trojan War. But it is full
of satire on the legendary heroes of ancient
times， while Cressida is depicted
a
mere
wanton， and Pandarus a clown.
ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL
A comedy by Shakespeare， written probably
about 1602-1603 and first printed in 1623. The
play takes us to France and has， as its unpleasant
subject， the wooing of an unworthy man of noble
birth by a far higher-natured girl and the better
being wedded to the worse. Helena， the orphan
daughter of a learned physician， has been long
in the house of the Countess of Rousillon，and
adores her son Bertram，with“his arched brows，
the court， leaving his mother with Helena. The
French king has a deadly disease. Helena goes to
Paris and cures it by a prescription left by her
father. The king promises to give her the hand
of any noble of his court whom she may choose.
She names Bertram， who at first refuses，but
then accepts her， in fear of the king's threats.
Then he goes to the war， writing to Helena that
she is not to call him husband till she can get his
ring from his finger，“which never shall come
off”， and is with child by him. She， following
him to Florence， finds that he tries to seduce
t
there.
Helena obtains permission to take Diana's place
in bed with him at midnight， and gives him the
ring which the king had before given her， in
exchange for his ring. Bertram returns to his
mother's house， and the king is already there.
Helena explains what has passed. The rings
are identified. Bertram's conditions have been
and declares that he will love her“dearly，
ever， ever dearly”. All's Well That Ends Well is
sometimes called， with Measure for Measure and
Troilus and Cressida，one of Shakespeare's
“problem comedies”or“dark comedies”.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE
A comedy by Shakespeare，probably written
in 1603 - 1604 and first printed in 1623. In this
play we have again an unpleasant subject for a
comedy. Vencentio， Duke of Vienna， is faced
with
the difficulty of enforcing severe laws
against unchastity after they have long fallen in
disuse. He finds that the claims of justice and
virtue
conflict
with
those
of
mercv
y
and
compassion. So he makes the experiment of
pretending to leave the country so as to give up
his power， for a time， to Angelo， a severe man，
and watch the experiment himself， disguised as
a friar. Claudio， a young man who has got his
sweetheart Juliet with child， is condemned to
0
death by Angelo. His sister Isabella， a saintlike
novice， goes to Angelo to plead for Claudio's
life. Isabella's prayers fail to win her brother's
life， but her beauty awakens Angelo's lust. At a
second interview， he promises that he will save
her brother if she will give up her chastity to
0
him.
She refuses him indignantly and
and visits
Claudio in prison， telling him of Angelo's offer.
He fears to die and pleads with her to let him
live. She scorns him for his meanness and bids
him to perish. The Duke， learning the infamous
conduct of Angelo， comes in as a friar， and
arranges that Isabella shall appear to consent to
Angelo， and then he will let Mariana， Angelo's
hypocrisy and blackmail are thus exposed. The
Duke spares his life on the appeals of Isabella
and Mariana， but bids him marry Mariana，
Claudio wed Juliet，
while he himself claims
Isabella as his bride.

ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA
A Roman tragedy by Shakespeare，probably
bo
it 1606-1607and first printed in
1623. The plot closely follows North's translation
of Plutarch. This play shows Mark Antony the
great Roman soldier and one of the “triumvirate”
74
(43-31 B.C.) who rules the whole empire，
love of Cleopatra， the voluptuous qu
queen of
e and
political
developments recall him to Rome. There h
ie
meets Octavius Caesar， his political rival， a sort
of friendship is restored between them，and
Antony weds his sister Octavia. This marriage
provokes the intense jealousy of Cleopatra. But
the reconciliation is short-lived.Hearing that
Octavius is warring again on Pompey， Antony
gathers forces. Octavia goes to Rome to sue for
peace， and arrives there， merely learning that
Antony has fled to Cleopatra.
War breaks out
between Octavius and Antony. When advantage
is with Antony， Cleopatra foolishly burns her
ships and flies. Antony retreats and is pursued to
Alexandria by Octavius， who asks Cleopatra to
yield him up. Antony prepares
for battle，
challenging Octavius to single combat. Octavius
laughs. After a momentary victory，Antony is
finally defeated in the battle. Now Octavius is
master. Cleopatra leaves Antony in grief， goes
to her“monument”，i. e. a mausoleum，and
sends word she is dead. Antony falls on his
sword and， being carried to Cleopatra， dies in
her arms.
Then
Cleopatra
a
n
makes
a
1
bid for
survival by pitting her wits against Octavius'，
but she fails. He intends to exhibit her in Rome.
She is seized but takes her own life by applying
asr
her breast and arm. The play shows
Antony
and Cleopatra as the victims of their
own character. The language is lyrical， colourful
and magnificent.
CORIOLANUS
A Roman tragedy by Shakespeare，probably
written about 1608 and printed in 1623. The story
about the legendary Roman hero Coriolanus is
taken from North's translation of Plutarch. The
Volscians， a neighbouring people of Rome，are
at war with the Romans. Coriolanus， a proud
Roman general， performs wonders of valour in
1
the war against the Volscians. On his return
with victory， it is proposed to elect him consul.
For this office he has to beg
common people， and show his wounds. He does
so and is elected. But the tribunes inflame the
crowd
1
a
against
him.
.
His
mother
Volumnia
prevails on him to bow his head and face his
accusers. His arrogant temper cannot stand it.
So the tribunes have no difficulty in banishing
him from Rome. To take revenge on Rome， he
ioins the
 Volscians and
leads
S
t
them
1
against
Rome. When he reaches the walls of the city，
his mother Volumnia，with his wife and son，
comes and beseeches him to spare Rome. He
yields to their prayers and retreats after making
a treaty favourable to the Volscians. Rome is
S
saved. But the Volscian general accuses him of
betraying their interests and has him assassinated as
a traitor. The play depicts Coriolanus from various
aspects： as a young nobleman in peacetime， as a
and
1 victor，
2
as
S
C
candidate
1
for consul
l in
nt
“napless garment of humility”， as a banished
renegade， and then as a leader of the Volscians，
enemies of Rome. It is one of Shakespeare's
finest plays， telling the story of a tragic hero
whose character is wholly dominated by pride
and so has no chance of survival under complicated
social conditions.
The Fourth Period(1608-1612)
The fourth period of Shakespeare's work is
the
period
of
f
romantic
cdrama.
It
tmainly
includes 4 romances or “reconciliation plays”
(Pericles，Cymbeline，
，
The
Winter's
S
1
Tale，
Tempest).With this period we turn from the
storm， the gloom， and the whirlwind of the
third period to“a great peacefulness of light”，
and a harmony of earth and heaven. True， there
is still treachery，ingratitude， breach of family-
relations，
misjudgment，
and
vice.'In
1
t
the
beginning，storms may run wild， and husband
loses his wife， father child；people，through
and beautiful； and the forces of evil may take
the upper hand
d and establish
1 themselves
i
in
But
Time， the Great
Healer，
will
intervene， by and by the wronged， patient in
adversity，shall be restored to their rightful
honour and position， and all shall be well in the
60
end.This
S
takes
place
not
t by any obvious
struggle， but by the final repentence of the
former tyrants and usurpers and the generous
forgiveness shown by the wronged to their foes.
So the gentle breezes have swept away the clouds
younger generation just beginning a happy new
life of their own.
The tone of calm and
reconciliation in the plays of the fourth period
has been associated by scholars with the change
of life and mood in the later years of Shakespeare，
wh
had then gradually abandoned the busy
dramatic work in London for the quiet life of a
country gentleman at Stratford. It might also
have something to do with the decline of the
stage during the reign of James I. So the scenes
of reunion of husband and wife， the love of
care over their children's destiny may reflect his
renewed life with his wife and his loving care of
his own daughters. Shakespeare placed his hopes
6
and aspirations with the future of mankind.
s during this period
that Shakespeare
collaborated
with
John Fletcher，
a
younger
playwright， in writing three dramas： Henry VIII， a
historical play， The Two Noble Kinsmen， a play
similar in sentiment to other romantic dramas，
and Cadenio， which is now missing.
With the performance of Henry VIII in 1613，
which caused the burning of the Globe Theatre
by the firing of the cannon at the end of Act I，
ended Shakespeare's dramatic career.
PERICLES
A
I
romance
e
play by Shakespear
re，
，
acted
probably in 1608，first printed in 1609， and then
in the third folio of 1664. The play tells an old
and
reunion after long parting. Pericles， prince of
Tyre， has guessed the secret infamy of Antiochus，
emperor of Greece. His life being threatened，
he flees his country， sailing to sea. His ship is
wrecked， and he is cast up at Pentapolis，where
the fishers he meets drag up his armour in their
nets. The next day he wins the hand of fair
Thaisa， daughter of King Simonides， by defeating
other suitors in contests. Shortly after， Antiochus
is dead. Pericles and Thaisa set off for Tyre. At
sea a daughter， Marina， is born to him during a
61
storm， but Thaisa， in a swoon，seemingly dies.
The sailors insist she shall be cast overboard，
and she is committed to the waves in a chest.
Pericles carries his daughter Marina to Tarsus，
where he entrusts her to Cleon， the governor，
and his
s wife， Dionyza.
Thaisa is
is cast
t up at
Ephesus， where a good physician saves her life.
Thinking her husband drowned， she becomes a
priestess in the temple of Diana. Marina grows
up in beauty and accomplishments at
at Cleon's
house. Dionyza， jealous of her great superiority
in every way， designs to kill her； but Marina is
carried off by pirates and sold in Mitylene into a
brothel， where her beauty and purity win the
admiration of Lysimachus， the governor， and
secure her release. Cleon and Dionyza put up a
mock tomb and give out she is dead.
going for his daughter， is overcome with grief
on hearing of her death. He puts to sea， and is
driven to Mitylene， where he meets and recognizes
his daughter， to his intense joy. Diana appears
to Pericles in a vision， and directs him to go to
Ephesus，where he finds his wife Thaisa. So，
after many toils，storms， and sorrows， come
peace， reunion and love. According to critics，
Acts I & II of the play are mainly or entirely
written by another hand， while the second half
mature style.
CYMBELINE
A
late romance
I
play or tragi-comedy by
Shakespeare，acted
d in 1610 =1611and first
printed in 1623. The plot combines a fragment
of British history from Holinshed's Chronicles
and
a story
v from Boccaccio's
S
1
Decameron.
Cymbeline， king of Britain， has two sons and a
daughter，Imogen. His sons， when very young，
have been stolen from him， and brought up in
Wales， by Bellarius， one of his nobles whom he
has treated unjustly. His daughter Imogen is left
at his court and educated with her playfellow
Posthumus， the orphan son of a knight. They
love each other and are secretly married. The
queen， Imogen's stepmother， reveals this secret
marriage to the king， who banishes Posthumus.
Posthumus goes to Rome， after giving his wife a
bracelet while she gives him a diamond ring.
At Rome，Posthumus boasts of the virtue of
Imogen， and enters into
a
v
wager on it with
Iachimo， an Italian nobleman.Iachimo comes
he gets taken into her bed-chamber in a trunk
and， while she is asleep， notes all the hangings
of the room and a mark on her body， and unclasps
her bracelet. He brings back all these as evidence
to Posthumus and convinces him of his wife's
infidelity.Posthumus
gives him the diamond
ring， and， mad with anger， writes to his servant
Pisanio， in Britain， to take Imogen to Wales and
kill her. Pisanio， taking pity on Imogen， spares
her， provides her with a man's
sclothes
and
leaves her in a forest. There she finds a cav
where her two lost brothers and Bellarius dwell.
They welcome her and treat her well. Meantime， a
Roman army invades Britain. Imogen falls into
the hands of a Roman general and becomes his
page. The battle is won by the Britons， and the
general，Imogen a
and Iachimo are all taken
prisoners，mainly by the valour of Bellarius， of
Cymbeline's
two sons，
and
Posthumus，\
joins Cymbeline's
troops.
The king
grants
Imogen a boon. At her instance Iachimo confesses
his lying treachery to Imogen and Posthumus.
Cymbeline，having
his
sons
and daughter
restored to him， forgives everybody， and all
ends
in a
reconciliation.
Pericles，
Cymbeline，
The
S
Tale，
and
The
c
are sometimes called “reconciliation
plays”，whose tragi-comical plot and conciliatory
tone seem to give Shakespeare's farewell message
to his audience that the good elements in life
are enduring and constructive， while the evil
must by their own nature reform themselves or
perish.
THE WINTER'S TALE
A romance play by Shakespeare， dated 1610-
1611 and not printed until the folio of 1623.This
tragi-comedy takes us to Sicily and Bohemia.
Leontes， king of Sicily， bids his wife Hermione，
a pure and noble woman， to entertain Polixenes，

Hermione is shown to Leontes. When the king's
grief for his wife's death is intensified by the
sight of this， the statue comes to life - it's
Hermione herself. A good woman has falsely
reported her death and kept her in hiding for
many years. Hermione forgives her husband and
embraces Perdita. So the play ends in reconciliation
and happiness.
THE TEMPEST
A romance play by Shakespeare，probably
written in 1611 and not printed till the folio of
1623. The play takes us to an enchanted island
in a sto
stormy sea. Prospero， the learned duke of
Milan， is ousted by his wicked brother Antonio，
and finds refuge with his little daughter Miranda
on an isolated island in the remote ocean. Miranda
has been brought up without ever seeing any man
except her father.Prospero， skilled in magic，
can rule the wind， the waves， and all nature. He
has made Ariel， a tiny fairy， to be his servant，
and subdued Caliban， a native of the
d
described as half beast and half man， to do hard
jobs. After many years， a ship carrying the
usurper Antonio， his confederate， the King of
Naples， and the king's son Ferdinand is wrecked
on the island - by the art of Prospero. They are
all saved， but Ferdinand is thought by the rest to
be drowned， and Ferdinand thinks the rest are
drowned. As soon as Ferdinand，a handsome
young man， meets Miranda， now a beautiful
64
young woman， he falls in love with her. But
Prospero puts him to a brief trial by setting him
to hew logs， and then let the young lovers make
their own choice. Ariel， by Prospero's order，
subjects Antonio and the king of Naples to
various terrors. Antonio is intimidated， the king
repents his wrong-doing， and Prospero forgives
sail to Naples to see his daughter wedded， and
then return to Milan， the dukedom of which is
most symbolic of Shakespeare's dramas.
There
are glimpses of the New World -a world of
Shakespeare's time. And the relationship between
Prospero and Caliban bears some resemblance to
the colonial explorations and conquests of the
early 17th century.
HENRY VIII
A historical play by Shakespeare in collaboration
with John Fletcher，probably written in 1612
and acted in 1613. The play is more episodic
more of a series of loosely connected episodes
than a skillfully plotted drama. We see first the
rivalry between the duke of Buckingham and
Cardinal
1
Wolsey，two magnates
S
at
t
Henry's
court. Buckingham is condemned to death on a
fabricated charge of treason.Meantime，Henry
has met and fallen in love with Anne Bullen，
pretending
that
his
conscience
is
S
troubled
because he married Queen Katharine who was
before betrothed to his dead brother. The royal
divorce is arranged. Queen Katharine is tried，
and the dignity and resignation of the Queen at
the trial is
vividly depicted. The divorce is
granted， but Wolsey opposes Henry's marriage
with Anne Bullen， and Henry deprives Wolsey
of his offices and possessions. Henry then weds
Anne Bullen， who is crowned queen with great
the future
een. Cranmer，Archbishop of
Canterbury，who has promoted Anne's marriage
and succeeds Wolsey in Henry's favour， makes a
speech about the glories of the future reign of
Queen Elizabeth I.
THE TWO NOBLE KINSMEN
This play is another joint work of Shakespeare
65
and Fletcher. It is a
tragi-comedy written in
1613 and printed in 1634. The main plot was
taken from Chaucer's The Kinght's Tale in The
Canterbury Tales. It tells the story of Palamon
and Arcite who are taken prisoners in war by
Theseus， King of Athens， but they both fall in
love with the latter's daughter Emilia. Though
their rivalry for love of Emilia is in conflict with
their mutual friendship， yet they show a nobility
amid twists and turns of their destiny. Theseus
decrees that the cousins shall duel for Emilia's
hand. The winner will marry her， and the loser
will be put to death. Palamon is defeated in
duel， but Arcite， at the moment of triumph， is
crushed by a running horse and dies. Palamon is
then pardoned by Theseus and marries Emilia
after mourning for Arcite. There is a sub-plot of
the release of Palamon from prison by the jailer's
daughter and her going mad for love of him.
Modern
scholars
believe
that
Shakespeare
planned the whole work and wrote Act One and
Act Five， leaving Fletcher to write the other
three acts， whereas most of the good poetry in
the play was written by Shakespeare.

Our whole universe was in a hot dense state.
Then nearly fourteen billion years ago expansion started. Wait.
The Earth began to cool，
The autotrophs began to drool，
Neanderthals developed tools.
We built a wall (we built the pyramids)，
Math，science， history， unraveling the mysteries，
That all started with the big bang!
Since the dawn of man is really not that long，
As every galaxy was formed in less time than it takes to sing this song.
A fraction of a second and the elements were made.
The bipeds stood up straight.
The dinosaurs all met their fate.
They tried to leap but they were late，
And they all died (they froze their asses off).
The oceans and pangea，
See ya， wouldn't wanna be ya!
Set in motion by the same big bang!
It all started with the big bang!
It's expanding ever outward but one day
It will cause the stars to go the other way，
Collapsing ever inward， we won't be here， it won’t be hurt.
Our best and brightest figure that it'll make an even bigger bang!
Australopithecus would really have been sick of us
Debating out while here they re catching deer (we're catching viruses).
Religion or astronomy，Encarta， Deuteronomy，
It all started with the big bang!
Music and mythology， Einstein and astrology，
It all started with the big bang!
It all started with the big bang!

Sheldon：Hang on. Based on the number
of chirps per minute and the ambient tem-

cricket.
Howard： Oh， give me a freakin’break.
How
could you possibly know that?O?
Sheldon： In 1890， Emile Dolbear determined
that there was a fixed relationship between
the number of chirps per minute of the
snowy tree cricket and the ambient temper-
ature. A precise relationship that is not pre-
sentwith ordinary field crickets.

agreement with Leonard， I've had unilateral
control of thermostat ever since

next week，

out of a pool， balancing a beach ball on
her nose.O2
Leonard： No， this has to stop now.
Sheldon： I'm not suggesting we really make
her jump out of a pool.
I thought the

Leonard，Howard and Raj： Kites， ho!
Sheldon：Excuse me.
You're misusing the
word “ho”. It's an interjection used to call
attention to a destination， not an object，as
in①，uh，“Land， ho!”Or， uh，“Westward，
ho!”
Leonard， Howard and Raj：

Penny： Hey， guys. Whatcha doin’?② Going out
to discover electricity?
Sheldon： If you're referring to the work
of
Benjamin Franklin③， he did not “discover e-
lectricity”. He merely used a kite to deter-
mine that lightning“consists”of④ electrici-
ty. He also invented the Franklin stove， bi-
focals and

the flexible urinary catheter.

Penny：

the sucking lie?

hiding him from⑨ her friends because he's a
tiny， little man who flies kites.

Wolowitz is trying to outflank us. Let out

Yes， you re delicious caramel，too.4
Penny： All right， you know what， I will tell you
why it's wrong...
Penny： What?
Sheldon： Biologically speaking， Howard is per-
fectly justified in seeking out the optimum
mate for the propagation of his genetic line.
Howard： Thank you， Sheldon.
Sheldon： Now， whether that propagation is in
the interest of humanity is， of course， an
entirely different question.

Kripke：
Oh， this is going to be a riot
01
Ira： Thanks for being with us today， Dr. Cooper.
Sheldon： My pleasure，Ira.
Ira： Now， let's talk about magnetic mono-
poles. Can you explain to our audience just
what a monopole is?
Sheldon： Of course. First，consider
④
an ordi-
as even the most
uneducated in your audience must know，
O2
two poles -a north and south pole. If you
cut that in half， you have two smaller mag-
nets，each⑤v
with its own north and south
pole.
Ira： Uh， Dr. Cooper， I think there might be
something wrong with our connection.
Sheldon： No， I hear you fine. O 3 As I was
saying， an ordinary magnet has two poles.
The primary characteristic of a monopole is
that it has only one pole， hence， monopole.
A requirement for String Theory， or M-theory，
if you will， is the existence of such mono-
poles. l， myself， led an expedition to the
Arctic Circle in search of said particles.

 It's not about shoes， is it?

Penny： It's not about shoes.
Sheldon： Then speak.
Penny： Um， actually， can we do it in private?
Sheldon： All right. Go away.OI agree，it's
rude， but she asked for privacy.
Penny： Thanks， Raj. Okay， so here's the thing：
I was wondering if you could maybe teach
me a little physics.
Sheldon： A little physics?OThere’s no such④
thing. Physics encompasses⑤the entire uni-
verse， from quantum particles to superno-
vas， from spinning electrons to spinning gal-
axies.
Penny： Yeah， okay， cool.

I don't need the
PBS special. 4I just want to know e-
nough so I can talk to Leonard about his
job. You know， like Bernadette does.
Sheldon： Why can't Leonard teach you?
Penny： 'Cause I want to surprise him.
Sheldon： Can't you surprise him in some other
way? For example， I'm sure he'd be de-
lightfully taken aback if you cleaned your a-
partment.
Penny： Come on， Sheldon， this is important to
me.

is physics?“ Physics” comes from
h the
ancient Greek
word
“ physika ”.It's at
this point that
you'll want to start taking
notes.“Physika”means the science of
natural things. And it is there， in ancient
Greece， that our story begins.
Penny： Ancient Greece?

your hand. O It's a warm summer eve-

And you look up at the night sky. There you
notice some of the stars seem to move， so
you name them“planetes”，or“wanderer”.
Yes，Penny?
Penny： Um， does this have anything to do with
Leonard's work?
Sheldon： This is the beginning of a 2，600-year
journey we're going to take together from
the ancient Greeks through Isaac Newton，
to Niels Bohr④， to Erwin Schrodinger⑤，
to the Dutch researchers that Leonard
is currently ripping off

necessary to maintain motion. So let's plug
in our 9.8 meters per second squared as
“a”and we get force-Earth gravity②—e-

this?O1
Penny： Uh， we know that...

Fig Newtonscome from?
Sheldon： No， Fig Newtons are named after
a
small town in Massachusetts.
Don't write
that down!O3
Penny： Sorry.

does that imply?

Leonard：
Would you be willing to read a book
that concisely explains how all psychics
are frauds?O
Penny： I would not.
Leonard： Okay， let's go see your psychic.
Penny： Really?
Leonard： Well， yeah， one of us has to keep
an open mind.
Penny： You saying I don't have an open mind?O?
Leonard： No， not at all. Let me help you with
this stuff.
Penny： You know， I believe in ghosts， too.
Leonard： Great.
Penny： And astrology.
Leonard： I know，and
I pyramid power and

Penny： Oh， no， no， no， crystals don’t work.

Really， that's the line? Psychics

Sheldon： Oh， dear lord.They re-did the menu.
Leonard： So what?It's the same food.
Sheldon：Oh， is it? Look at this. General
Tso's Chicken is no longer listed under
“Specialties”. It's now under “Chicken”
O1
Raj： So?
Sheldon： Yes， General Tso.
Raj： Not“Tso”-The chicken；“So”-The
question.So?O
Sheldon： So， why is it no longera specialty?
Did the chef lose confidence in④ the dish or
hims
? And look over here. “Shrimp in
mobster sauce.”What is“mobster sauce”?
Leonard： It's obviously a typo.
Sheldon： Perhaps.
Or perhaps this restaurant's
now a front for organized crime.O3 For all
we know，the mobster sauce contains actual
chunks of deceased mobsters.
5
Raj： No， no， no， no. I think it just means it's
the kind of sauce that mobsters like.
Howard： It doesn't mean any of that! It's a ty-
po.

Let's just get a

In anticipation of their arrival， I've

now， here are my prints so you can rule me

It's too early to

Leonard： Would I be completely out of line

What is he doing now?O4
Leonard： Hmm， he's either isolating the terms of
his formula and examining them individually，
or... looking for the alligator that swallowed
his hand after Peter Pan cut it off.
Sheldon： Captain Hook's hand was eaten by a
crocodile， not an alligator. lf you're going

Staff： Well， thank you for noticing. I’m “Menial
Employee of the Month”.Do you have
a particular field in mind?

their lives laboring to erect monuments under
the lash of their betters， until finally， they
dropped downand became one with the
dust through which they trudged.
Do you
have anything like that?O3
Staff： No.
Sheldon： Shouldn't you check your database?
Staff： No.
Sheldon： You didn't really type.

came to mind①. That toll booth attendant，

There's a $ 39. 95 lover's special at P. F.

in Appendix C： Future Commitments. Number
37：“In the event one friend is ever invited to
visit the Large Hadron Collider now under
construction in Switzerland， he shall invite
the other friend to accompany him.”
Leonard： Oh， for God's sakes.
Penny： You actually put that in an agreement?O?
Leonard： Yeah. We also put in what happens
if one of us wins a MacArthur Grant， or if
one of us gets superpowers， or if one of us
is bitten by a zombie.
Sheldon： He can't kill me， even if I turn④.
Penny： Is there anything in there about if one
of you gets a girlfriend?

Dr.
Leonard Hofstadter.O2

demonstrate that I was improperly instructed in

society borders on the sociopath. I will argue

Leonard： Let me explain what we're doing
here. Um， in 1969，the astronauts on Apol-
lo 11④positioned reflectors on the surface of
the moon， and we're going to shoot a laser
off one of them and let the light bounce back
into this photomultiplier.
Penny： Oh! That's very cool.
Zack： One question. How can you be sure it
won't blow up⑤?
Leonard： The laser?
Zack：
The moon.O3
Sheldon： See，now this is a man for Penny.O4
Leonard： That's a great question，Zack.
Sheldon： No， it's not.
Penny： Sheldon! Play nice.
Sheldon： It's not a great question. How could
somebody possibly think we re going to
blow up the moon? That's a great question.

Sheldon up for online dating.

The History of Everything
Our whole universe was in a hot dense state.
Then nearly fourteen billion years ago expansion started. Wait.
The Earth began to cool，
Neanderthals developed tools.
We built a wall (we built the pyramids)，
Math， science，history， unraveling the mysteries，
That all started with the big bang!
As every galaxy was formed in less time than it takes to sing this song.
A fraction of a second and the elements were made.
The bipeds stood up straight.
The dinosaurs all met their fate.
They tried to leap but they were late，
And they all died (they froze their asses off).
The oceans and pangea，
See ya， wouldn't wanna be ya!
Set in motion by the same big bang!
It all started with the big bang!
It's expanding ever outward but one day
It will cause the stars to go the other way，
Collapsing ever inward， we won’t be here， it won’t be hurt.
Our best and brightest figure that it'll make an even bigger bang!
Australopithecus would really have been sick of us
Debating out while here they re catching deer (we re catching viruses).
Religion or astronomy，Encarta，Deuteronomy，
It all started with the big bang!
Music and mythology， Einstein and astrology，
It all started with the big bang!
It all started with the big bang!

neurobiologist like Babinski①could ever rise
to the significance of a physicist like Clark
Maxwell② or Dirac③?
Amy： I'm stating it outright.
Babinski eats
Dirac for breakfast and defecates Clarke
Maxwell.
D1
Sheldon： You take that back.O2
Amy： Absolutely not. My colleagues and I are
mapping the neurological substrates that
subserve global
information
processing，
which is required for all cognitive reason-
ing， including scientific inquiry， making my
research ipso facto④prior⑤ in the ordo cog-
noscendi. That means it's better than his re-
search，and
by extension， of course，
yours.

Sheldon： Excuse me， but a grand unified the-
ory， insofar as it explains everything， will
ipso facto explain neurobiology.
Amy： Yes， but if I'm successful， I will be able
to map and reproduce your thought proces-
ses in deriving a grand unified theory， and
therefore， subsume your conclusions under
my paradigm.

psychologism，

My relationship with Amy was purely intel-

woman. You two are definitely not suit for
each other.
Sheldon： That's a peculiar conclusion. By any
standard， Amy is more similar to me than
anyone I've ever met.
Mrs. Cooper： Oh， I'm sorry，Shelly， I can't
see it.
Sheldon： Well， whether you see it or not is ir-
relevant. I can't see subatomic particles，
but nevertheless， they're there.

we may have acted rashly. O：I propose
we resume our relationship and attempt
to④ resolve our differences.

you.

I don't want to speak
to the FBI.O2
Leonard： Why not?
Raj： I'm brown and I talk funny.
Howard： They're just doing a background check
on me.
Raj： It doesn't matter.  They'll find a rea-
son to give me a one-way ticket back to
Gandhi-ville. By the way⑤， when I say
that， it's not offensive.
Leonard： Don't be ridiculous， Raj. You're here
legally.
Raj： Nobody cares. Do you know how long it's
been since I got through airport security
without being given a colonoscopy?

Agent Page： Who?
Leonard：Mulder and Scully . X-Files.
③1
“The truth is out there.”Never mind④.Uh，
so， what would you like to know?
Agent Page： You work with Mr. Wolowitz here
at the university，correct?
Leonard： Yes. Of course， we're in different
departments. He's an engineer and I'm an
experimental physicist. You know， one of
those guys who examines
building
blocks of creation and says，
“Hello， maker
of the universe. I see what you did there.
Good one.
02
Agent Page： Right. Now， how would you cha-
racterize your relationship with Mr. Wolowitz?
course，
9
most of my relationships are
good. 3 Probably because l exude confi-

know? Confidence， not exuding.

Q
Agent Page： I just want to ask you a few ques-
tions about Howard Wolowitz.
Sheldon： Oh. All right. I doubt anyone would
risk the stiff penalties for impersonating a
federal officer just to ask questions about a
minor league engineer with an unresolved
oedipal complex.
Agent Page： Thank you.
Sheldon： For the record， I truly support the
FBI in the mission which is expressed throu-
gh their motto...
Agent Page： Fidelity， bravery， integrity.O
Sheldon：
Correct. Now the business.O2 18
years ago， I sent the FBI crime lab samples
from a bag of excrement that had been lit on
fire on my front porch... for fingerprinting
and DNA analysis. Why haven't I heard
Agent Page： Well， the FBI crime lab does
back yet?
have a lot on its plate. Would you mind if
we talked about Mr. Wolowitz now?
Sheldon： A little，O but go on.
Agent Page： Would you characterize him as
responsible?
Sheldon：
I'm going to answer that with a
3
visual aid.4 This is my nine-disc com-
Mr. Wolowitz borrowed it， damaged plastic
retention hub number three... and then re-
turned it to me， hoping I wouldn't notice.
Would you characterize that as responsible?

about Howard Wolowitz.
Sheldon： Yes.
Agent Page： Was your statement untrue?
Sheldon： No.
Agent Page： Then I'm afraid you can't with-
draw it.
Sheldon： I'm sorry. I don’t recall you saying
“No backsies”.O2
Agent Page： Is there anything else?
Sheldon： Yes. I'd like to offer a laudatory

statement about Howard's many excellent
qualities that I believe will tip the scales
back in his favor.“Howard Joel Wolowi-
tz. H is for honesty， of which he has much.
O's for outstanding， which he is such. W's

Sheldon：Penny，you face failure on a daily

Penny：1
Sheldon：
To drinking. Nope.O  If only there
were some way to force Howard toaccept
my apology so I could escape this miasma
of guilt.
Penny： You know， sometimes stuff just hap-
pens， and there's nothing you can do about
it. Lisa Peterson hasn't talked to me since
the 8th grade， because no matter how much
you apologize，you can't go back④ and un-

also designed the iconic red and black jack-

should come with us Friday to see it on the
big screen at the Colonial.

start till midnight.
Sheldon： Another way of saying that is“the
movie starts at midnight， and it's already
5：00”.Let's go.O1
Howard： You know， if we miss it， we'll have
it for the rest of our lives.

hours， while you napped in a lawn chair；
he got in a fight with a Klingon when he
stepped out of line to pee and you wouldn't

that's how you tell a knock-knock joke. Un-

you've only selected seven hours of reading

Sheldon： Are you monitoring your circadian
rhythms in order to
identifyyour periods
of maximum mental acuity? I did that one
sur
mmer. Ah，youth.O
Amy：No，I experienced some distressing
symptoms last night， so I'm checking my vi-
tal signs every hour.
Sheldon： I'd be happy to create a chart and
participate in a different diagnosis.
Amy： Oh， that sounds like fun.O2
Sheldon： Describe the scene for me.
Amy： I was sitting in a restaurant with Penny
and Bernadette， drinking water-carbona-
ted as it was a special occasion. Penny's
2
friend Zack stopped byand said hello and I
said“hoo”.
Sheldon：
Who?O3
Amy： Zack.
Sheldon： Then why did you ask?O
Amy： Ask what?
Sheldon： Who.
Amy： Zack.
Sheldon： All right， let's start over. What did
you say when Zack walked in?
Amy：“Hoo”.
Sheldon： Zack.
Amy： Why do you keep saying“Zack”?
Sheldon： Because you keep saying“who”.

in the demonstration， but then he got cold
115
00：08：32-00：09：37
Howard： No. Something very specific that we
both know you，Rajesh Koothrappali，are
terrified①of.
Raj： Well，type two diabetes runs② in my fami-
ly. The thought of losing a toe.O
Howard： Spiders! You’re afraid of spiders!
Raj： What the heck is this?
Howard： A jar with a big spider in it， of course.
Bravery test.
First one to take his hand
out is the sidekick.C
●2
Raj： Are you crazy?
Howard： Perhaps. Are you scared?
Raj： No. But it's a stupid test.
Howard：
0
Oh， really?O3 What if the Earth was
in dangerand the only way to save it was
to stick your hand in a jar with a spider?
Raj： Oh， yeah? What if the Earth was in dan-
ger and the only way to save it was to take
a shower in the locker room and let other
guys see you naked?
Howard： Oh，come on. That's never gonna
happen. Put your hand in the jar or forever
be revealed as my sidekick.
Raj： All right， I will.
Howard： How did you get so brave all of a
sudden?
Raj： It's easy.
The spider's crawling up
_your
am.C4
116
people are in danger； we must help them
All of a sudden， I hear a scream out of my
L：
117
00：10：45—00：12：03
Sheldon： Did you see Star Trek： The Motion
Picture? It's terrible. However... in it， we
learn that when Spock finds himself drawn
off the path of logic by feelings bubbling
upfrom his human half， he suppresses
Kolinahr.
Amy： Are you suggesting we live our lives
guided by the philosophies found in cheap
science fiction?
Sheldon：Cheap science fiction?O1
Amy： What are you doing?
Sheldon：
：
Using Kolinar to suppress my anger
at that last comment.O
02
Amy： Is it possible that your concern form
ie
at this moment is motivated by nothing more
than simple jealousy?
Sheldon： I hadn't considered that. Give me a
moment. All right， I've considered it.
Ire-
iect it.O3
Amy： You reject it because you don't feel jeal-
ousy， or because you are suppressing jeal-
ousy?
Sheldon：
I think I’ll eat my lunch at home.@4
Amy： That's not your lunch， Sheldon；
；those
are the cadaver brain specimens.
Sheldon： As they were incorrectly sliced， you
can see how I could mistake them formy
sashimi.

：
00：15：06—00：16：14
Leonard：
Really?O  This is going to decide
who's the hero and who's the sidekick?
Howard： You got a better idea?
Leonard： Every idea is better than this idea.
Howard： Ding.
Raj： Wai， what the hell is“ding”?
Howard： It's a bell.
Raj：1 don't think this kind of wrestling has a
bell.
Howard： Fine. How do you want to start?
Raj：I say，uh， how about one， two， three，
go?
Howard： One，two，three，go?
That's for
babies.O3
Raj： Okay， how about， uh... on your mark，
get set， go?
Howard： That's for a footrace. lf you want to
race， we have to go outside.
Raj： No， it's chilly outside. Didn't bring my
iacket.
Howard： Oh， for crying outloud. What kind
of superhero needs a jacket?
Raj： What kind of superhero says，“Dibs on the
red tights! Dibs on the red tights!”
Howard： All right， how about this? Ready，
wrestle.
Raj： Wait. Are we starting now? Or is that
or...
Howard： We're starting now!
Raj： Don't yell at me!
Leonard：

there are worse ways to
spend a Friday night.C

She was so sad that she couldn't help cry-
00：01：17—00：02：32
Zack：
I want to talk science with the science
dudes.O1
Howard： Oh， and the science dudes want to
talk science with you. What do you want to
talk about， rocks，dinosaurs， our friend the
beaver?
Zack： You know， I saw this great thing on the
Discovery Channel①. Turns out that if you
kill a starfish， it'll just come back to life
③
Sheldon：
Was the starfish wearing boxer
watching Nickelodeon
.
Zack： No， I'm almost sure that it was the Dis-
covery Channel. It was a great show. They
also said dolphins might be smarter than
people.
Leonard：
They might be smarter than some
people.O3
Zack： Maybe we can do an experiment to find
out.
Sheldon： That's easy enough. We'd need a
large tank of water， a hoop to jump through，
3
you find tasty.
and a bucket of whatever bite-sized treats
Zack：
1
don't get it.4
Leonard： A dolphin might.
Zack： Oh， I see. You guys are inferringthat
I'm stupid.
Sheldon： That's not correct. We were impl-
ying it. You then inferred it.

scious for ten hours and finally came back
123
00：04：45-00：05：50
Sheldon： Penny.
Penny： What?
Leonard： We came to talk to Zack. Hey， Zack.
Zack： What do you want?
Leonard： Listen， the stuff we were saying be-
fore， we were just kidding around.
Zack： No， you weren't. You were making fun
ofme.
Leonard：Come on， that's what we do. We
give each other a hard time④. Hey， Shel-
don， you look like a praying mantis.O1
Sheldon：That's very hurtful.O2
Leonard： See?
Zack： I don't know. It still wasn't very nice.
Sheldon：Milk Dud?O3
Zack： Oh， I love Milk Duds. Okay， we're cool.
Sheldon：Junior Mints.O4
Zack： You guys want to come in and have a
beer?
Leonard： Uh， we're on our way to the comic
book store.
Howard： Leonard's buying.
⑥
Zack： Really? I haven't been to a comic book
store in literally a million years.
Sheldon： Literally? Literally a million years?
Leonard： Don't.
Zack： You want to go with 'em?
Penny： No.
Zack： Okay， see you later.
124
125
00：07：03-00：08：18
Stuart： So are you guys coming to my New
Year's Eve costume party?
Sheldon： Of course. We're coming as the Jus-
tice League of America.
Howard： Switching it up② from last year when
we came as the Justice League of America.
Sheldon： To that point，it occurs to me that
we might have an opportunity to finally
snare Best Group Costume if we shore up④
our weak link，
，
which is clearly Leonard as
Superman.
C

Leonard： Hey， I got new boots this
year.
Guaranteed to add three inches.
Sheldon：
That's sad.O Let's ask ourselves：
Is there anyone we know who would make a
more manly and convincing son of Kryp-
ton5?
Stuart： Than Leonard in high-heeled boots?
Howard's mother in high-heeled boots?
Sheldon ： I was thinking specifically of the gen-
tleman over there moving his lips as he en-
joys the latest exploits of Betty and Veroni-
ca.
Leonard： Zack?
Howard： He is the only person we know with
actual muscles.
Leonard： You can't replace me with⑨ Zack.
Sheldon：V
Why not? Penny did it.
O3
Howard： Yeah， she seems happier.
Why wou-
idn't we be?O4
126
127
00：08：47—00：09：57
Raj：1 don't want to be Aquaman. He sucks.
He sucks underwater. He sucks fish pee.
Sheldon： Excuse me， I believe aquaman uses
their business elsewhere.
Zack： Hey，babe.
Penny： I'm still mad at you.
Zack： Well， you won't be when you hear the
great news.
Penny： What great news?
Zack： We're going to a costume party at the
comic book store on New Year's Eve，and
you get to be Wonder Woman
Sheldon： Complete with bulletproof bracelets
and lasso of truth.

parately.

Howard：
She and her lab team are under qu-
arantine
 Seems at the Christmas par-
ty they were doing Jell-O shots out of petri
dishes that used to contain yellow fever.
Penny： Okay， what about your friend Amy?
Sheldon： Amy Farrah Fowler doesn't believe
in⑤ wearing costumes.
She isn't the free
spirit Iam.O4
Penny： Okay， well， forget it. I'm not spend-
ing my New Year's Eve at a comic book
store wearing a Wonder Woman costume.

00：10：15-00：11：47
Leonard：
What are you doing?O1
Sheldon： We're going to be late. I'm pacing
nervously.
Leonard： You're jogging.
Sheldon：
：This is how the Flash
D
paces.
MO2
Leonard： Just chill out②， Sheldon.
Sheldon：I'm not Sheldon. I'm the Flash.

And now I'm going to the Grand Canyon③ to
130
scream in frustration. I'm back.
④
Howard： I'm Batman.
Sheldon： Oh， I hardly think so. The real caped
crusader calls his crime-fighting cohorts when
he's running late.
Howard： I had to walk. I couldn't get Raj on
the back of my scooter.
Raj： I've said this before， and I'lII say it again.
Aquaman sucks.
Zack： Look up⑤ in the sky. It's a bird. It's a
plane. I forget the rest.4
Penny： All right. Let's get this thing over
6
Sheldon： I'm sorry. But in what universe is
Wonder Woman blonde?
Howard： Relax. No one's going to be looking
at her hair. Ow!Imean，ow.
Zack：Hold on. The costume came
with a
black wig. Where is it， babe?
Penny： No. I'm not wearing it. It looks stupid.
131
00：15：13—00：16：57
Penny： It's open. I'm not going to that party，
Leonard.
Leonard： Okay， listen. You don’t have to wear
the wig. At this party，
we re gonna win
first prize just by showing up
with a
girl.C
①1
Penny： It's not the wig.
Leonard： Did I do something? I mean， I tried
to be friends with Zack， like you said，
which believe me， was difficult， given how
you and me used to be②. you know，“You
and me，”and now you and him are“You
and him”.
Penny： Okay， look. We're not really “Me and
him”.
Leonard： Then what are you?
Penny： I don't know. I only started seeing Zack
again so I wouldn't be alone on New Year's
Eve. How pathetic is that?
Leonard：
1：N
Not as pathetic as dressing up
like this and going to a comic book store
on New Year's Eve.O2
Penny： You make a cute Green Arrow.
Leonard： Green Lantern⑤.

Leonard： I had a great idea. You know how
we're always having to stop and solve dif-
ferential equations， like when you're doing
Fourier analysis， or using the Schrdinger
equation②?
Sheldon： Howard doesn't.
He's only an engi-
neer.O1
Leonard： I was thinking， we could write a little
app that would use handwriting recognition，
and then run it through a symbolic evalua-
take a picture of the equation and bam!
Raj： You know what's a great app?
The one

that makes fart noises.O2

edge to④ the cat. I'll save you the pain and

very plausible scenario. A young woman a-
lone in the big city， her ridiculous dream of
becoming an actress lies shattered about
her.
Penny： Hey，wait a minute.
Howard： Well， hang on②.
Let's see where
Sheldon： Then it hits③ her. How is she going
to survive? But she has no prospects， no
marketable skills. And then one day，
she
meets a group of geniuses and their friend

Howard： Hey， I...

Let's see where he's going.

Sheldon： She befriends them，and then lies
in wait until they reveal a marketable idea，
which she steals and sells to the highest
bidder.

our various duties and the path we will fol-

as we develop our ground-breaking
new app.

sion we're a vast enterprise that uses over-
seas call centers.
Raj： Oh. Very clever.  But still racist.
Sheldon： Duly noted， Steve from Wichita.
sistant?
Sheldon： Because the word“Secretary”has
fallen intodisrepute. FYI，my mother's
birthday is coming up. I'm going to need
you to pick up a present.
O3
Leonard： Okay， we need to stop for a minute.
Sheldon： Leonard， please， we can talk during
our break. We have one coming up at mid-
night. We'll need snacks.
Leonard： Sheldon， you're not in charge. It's
my idea. I'm in charge.
Sheldon： Oh， of course you are. Look at the
organizational chart. You're clearly listed
as founder.
Leonard： Well， yes， and you're listed as Chief
Executive Officer，Chief Financial Officer
and Chief Operating Officer.

ferential Optimized Numerator.
Raj： So it spells“Sheldon”.O
Sheldon：
D
Does it?O② A happy accident.
Leonard： We're not doing names now. How-
ard?
Howard： Like I was saying， right now it's just
a dummy procedure， but eventually， it will
drop us into③.….
Sheldon： All right， fine④. If we’re not going to
give it a name， can we at least give it a se-
cret code designation?
Leonard： No.
Sheldon： Here me out. The atomic bomb was
The Manhattan
Project.Windows
was
originally Project Chicago. For our app， I
would humbly suggest Project Nodlehs.
Leonard：
That's just “Sheldon”Backwards.O
Sheldon： Another happy accident.
Leonard： We're not wasting time with names
right now.
Sheldon： I see. Is that decision open for dis-
cussion?
Leonard： No.
Sheldon：
Is the decision to not discuss it open
Leonard： No.
140
141
00：10：52—00：12：32
Raj： Mm. Last night， I had a dream. We got
so rich from the app. You and I bought
matching side-by-side mansions. But... there
was a secret tunnel connecting your front
yard to my back yard. What do you think
that means?
Howard： It means after we play handball， I'm
showering at home.
Sheldon： Good morning， Friend Howard. Frie-
nd Raj. I see you gentlemen are enjoying
beverages. Perhaps they would taste better
out of these.
Raj：“World's Greatest Astrophysicist”?

Howard：
Howard Wolowitz”.Why not
2
“World's Greatest Engineer”?
Sheldon： I'm sorry. I typed that into the label
maker， but I just couldn't press enter.
Now down to business. What would it take
for
you to abandon Leonard and join me
in a rival company? Unless， of course， the
mugs are sufficient， in which case， wel-
come aboard.O3
Howard： We're not quitting onLeonard.
Sheldon： l understand. Your loyalty is admira-
ble. But what if I were to up the ante⑤?

built-in laser pointer. No? How about can
cot? Go， Beavers.

you.
Sheldon： Well，
，we sure saw that coming.
O1
Sheldon： You know what I'm going to do? I am
going to sit here and just let them stew.
Penny： No， no， no. You know， they have suf-
fered enough.
Everybody's suffered en-
ough.O The thing is， you're going to have
to offer him a face-saving way out of this.
Sheldon： How?
Penny： Say you're sorry.
Sheldon： Oh， no. Mrs.
N
Mary Cooper didn't
2
raise her no，liars.O3
Penny： Okay. Um... How about this? You
how you're always trying to learn
about sarcasm?
Sheldon： No.
Penny： No?
Sheldon： I was being sarcastic.
3
Penny： Oh. Good for you.③ So all you have to
do here is say you're sorry to Leonard， but
say it sarcastically.
Sheldon：
Of course.4 He will hear it as an
attempt to mend fences⑤， as opposed to⑥
the withering condemnation you and I will
know it to be.
Penny： Yeah. Yeah， that was my plan.

Penny： No， I really..I'm sorry， free what?
Sorry，what，what?
Leonard： I think her weekend just opened up①.
Penny： Wait，wait， just to be clear， when you
guys say“Spa”， does that mean the same
thing aswhen regular people say it?
Leonard：Pretty much.

Except we keep our
shirts on in the sauna.O2
I'm going to cancel my plans so I can do this
for my bestie.

first has to work.O4
Penny： You know， for a smart guy， you really
seem to have a hard time grasping the con-
cept “Don't piss off the people who handle
the things you eat.”
Amy： That does seem to be a valid principle.
146
her weekends are available.
What you need is to take a long vacation
147
Sheldon： Good morning. If I could have every
one's attention①，please? I know we're all
eager to get on the road toBig Sur so if
we focus， I'm sure we can get through this
orientation in under a half an hour.
.T
Then
it's just Q&A， quiz， safety drills. pose
for commemorative group photo and we re
off.O1
Leonard： Don't worry. Just sit next to me dur-
ing the quiz and you can copy my answers.
Sheldon： Raj? What are you doing? I don't
think so.①： You've had your allotted six
ounces. The first bathroom break isn't until
2
the Denny's located near Bakersfield which
is approximately two and half hours away.
Remember，people， we're only as strong
Howard： Nobody cares about your Kegel exer-
cises.
Sheldon： All right. We have seven people， and
two cars. In the lead car， driven by Leonard
will be... myself，Amy Farrah Fowler and
Penny.
Amy： Yes! He had you in the other car， but l
got you upgraded.O3
Penny：Y
Yay!O4
Sheldon： She made the case that if we break
down in the middle of nowhere， your Ne-
braska backwoods skills and brawny hands
will give us the best chance to survive in
the wild.

00：04：06—00：05：18
Sheldon：Red leader to red five， come in. Red
promised.
Howard：Fine. Red five to red leader. What do
you want now?
Sheldon： It's 11：15. I'm requesting your quarter-
hourly location update.
Howard：Still right behind you.
Sheldon：Copy that， red five. Radio contact is
sufficient. No need to extend your middle
finger.
Penny：So，Amy， I've been wondering①
D
are
you and Sheldon going to be sharinga room?
Amy： No， we discussed it. We decided we
didn't want to jeopardize our relationship by
getting to know each other too well.
Sheldon： Indeed. Nothing sours a friendship
more than over-familiarity③with someone's
toilet routine.
Leonard：
1
I can vouch for
Penny： Hey.
Leonard： Not you， him.
Penny： Oh. Thanks.
Leonard： Although yours was an eye-opener.
O2
Amy：Don't worry，Penny. You're my plus-
one. You'll bunk with⑤ me. And FYI，
，i
travel
roommate.O3
Penny： Terrific
Are we there yet?O
150

They usually bunk with each other when

Leonard： Are you... an element in the actinoid
series①?
Sheldon： No. Amy?
Amy： Are you usually radioactive when found
in nature?
Sheldon： No.
Amy： Are you in the lanthanoid series?
.●：Pen-
ny?
Penny： Uh，I don’t know.…. Are you food?O?
Sheldon： That's not apropos. We've already
established I'm found in the periodic ta-
ble④.
Penny：
Well， it's a table，right?OImean，
why can't there be food on it?

I knew she wasn't lead car materiel.O4

all exhausted and he was threatening to fil-

certain ring to it.
Penny： I don't understand why you people just
let him bully you like this. Someone should
stand up to him. What’s he going to do? I can't
believe you let him kick me out of the car.
Howard： What could we do? He's the travel
supervisor.
152
153
00：16：40—00：18：39
Sheldon： Good morning and welcome to Sci-
ence and Society. I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper
BS，MS，MA PhD，and ScD. OMG，right?O
Perhaps that joke was a little too hippie-
dippy for this crowd . All right then， we'll
begin with opening remarks. Miss Rosten-
kowski， would you like to start us off by?
discussing your assessment of science's re-
sponsibilityto society?
Bernadette： Sure. I think all branches of sci-
ence have to move cautiously these days.
It's not just giant nuclear weapons that can
destroy the world. As a microbiologist，
can tell you even the tiniest organisms can
2
still tear
you a new one.O2
Howard： Interesting. I think what you might
need to know about my colleague is that
though she claims her field of interest is tiny
organisms she certainly has spent her fair
share of time around what we can assume
was pretty massive weaponry.
Bernadette： I think Mr.Wolowitz needs to
keep in mind that the past is the past.
But
3
he should know that I am the kind of girl
who could get all the giant missiles she
wants.
O3
Sheldon： Because I'd like to weigh in. Dr.
Koothrappali，would you care to join the
conversation?
Raj： Certainly.
1
These mimosas are kicking my
little brown ass.O4

Bernadette： Oh， come on， Howard， be realistic.
Howard： What， I'm not hot enough for Angeli-

Raj： I'd like to weigh in here. No.
Sheldon： All right， why don’t we open it up to
Q& A from the audience?
anybody who can get me the hell out of
there and back to Los Angeles tonight?
Glenn： I'm driving back to L. A. tonight.

Leonard： Sure.
Amy： Are you bothered by the fact that your
former girlfriend left the symposium with
what is probably the most beautiful man I've
ever seen in my life?
Leonard： No. Why do you ask?
Amy：
Because we re going 120 miles per hour.

Howard： So， how'd the lecture go?
Sheldon： In a word， triumphant.

Leonard： Really? Triumphant?
Sheldon： Oh， yes， you should have seen those
young people. Thirsty for knowledge， dr-

I may have changed
a few lives today.O

Amy： Well， the first thing that comes to mind?
is isolating the part of your brain where the
memory is stored and destroying it with a
laser.
Sheldon：
Hmm，no.③1 One slip of the hand，
and suddenly I'm sitting in the Engineering
Department，building doodads with Wolowi-

Amy： All right. Have you considered improving
your socialization skills， thus allowing you
to communicate more effectively with other
people?
Sheldon： Isn't that their burden?
1
I'm the one
with something interesting to say.
O2
Amy： Fair enough， but in its essence④，teach-
ing is a performance art. In the classroom
paradigm， the teacher has the responsibility
to communicate， as well as entertain and
engage.
Sheldon： I sense that you're trying to slow-
walk me to an epiphany.
.Would you mind
very much jumping toit?：
Amy

you should consider⑥
taking
acting lessons.
Sheldon： Acting lessons. Interesting.4 It
might help if I could act as though I care a-
bout my students and whether or not they
learn.

Sheldon： It has been suggested  to me that
acting techniques could improve my lectu-

are to be believed， I“suck the big one”.
Penny： Yeah， I saw those. They were funny.I
printed a few out and put'em onr
my fri-

Sheldon： So， when could we start?
Penny： Okay，just to be clear. You are asking
me for help④ because I know something that
164
the brilliant Dr. Sheldon Cooper doesn't.
Sheldon：Isuppose that’s one way to look at
it.

Penny： I think it’s the only way to look at it.
Sheldon： Are you going to help me or not?
Penny： Probably. I'm just enjoying the fore-
play. Does this mean you are done mocking
my acting career?

Sheldon： Penny，Penny，Penny!
Penny： What's wrong?
Sheldon： Nothing. I was acting.
Penny： You were acting.
Sheldon： Yes. In preparation for① today's st-
udies， I read Stanislavski's An Actor Pre-
pares ， Stella Adler's The Technique of Act-
ing， Uta Hagen's Respect for Acting， and
Henry Winkler's Ayyy， I'm an Actor.
Penny： Well， good for you. Come on in.
Sheldon： How shall we begin?
Penny： Well， I thought we'd start with some
basic movement exercises. You know， get

Penny： So I just want you to relax and kind of
move around in the space.

This feels natural. Certainly more
natural than what you're doing.

Sheldon： Yes. I didn't care for it.O1
Penny： Okay，Cat on a Hot Tin Roof② is an A-
merican classic.
Sheldon：
So is the McRib sandwich.O2
don't care for that， either.
Penny： Fine. What would you rather do as a
scene study?

of adapting a Star Trek fan fiction novella l
wrote when I was ten into a one-act play.

Here's what I wonder about zombies.
What happens if they can't get any human

Howard：
You take this one. I spent
an
hour last night on“How do vampires shave
when they can't see themselves in the mir-
ror?”
Sheldon： Well-groomed vampires meet in pairs①
and shave each other—
case closed.O3
Raj： Yeah， okay. So， zombies.
Leonard： I guess it depends on② the zombies，
Raj. Are we talking slow zombies， fast
zombies? Like， in28 Days③， if those zom-
bies didn't eat， they starved.
Howard： You're thinking of 28 Days Later. 28
Days is where Sandra Bullock④ goes to rehab
and puts the audience into an undead state.

mingled among them， to find out how he
was being perceived by his subjects.

good eats， might even be a few pretty girls.
Howard： Sounds great! I'm in!①
Sheldon： Hold on②. Just because the nice man
is offering you candy， doesn't mean yo
OU
should jump into his windowless van.
What's
Dr. Siebert：Just a little fund-raiser for the
university.
Sheldon：Aha! The tear-stained air mattress
in the back of the van.O
Dr. Siebert： l understand your reticence，Dr.
Cooper， and I sympathize， but the hard
facts are， occasionally， we have to shake a
few hands and kiss a few butts to raise mon-
ey for our research.
Sheldon：1 don't care；
it's demeaning.O3
And I refuse to③ be trotted out and shown
off like a prize hog at the Texas State
Fair. Which， by the way， is something you
ensign's uniform.
Dr. Siebert： All right， let me put it this way⑤.

come to this party， and you're gonna ex-

Leonard： Oh. We should get going.
Howard： What about Sheldon?

Sheldon： Sheidon is not going.
Leonard： Really? What do we tell Siebert?
Sheldon： Tell him Dr. Cooper feels that the
best use of his time is to employ his rare
and precious mental faculties to tear the mask
off④ nature and stare atthe face of God.

Koothrappali and Howard Wolowitz.
Mrs. Latham： Well，what happened to you
2
Wolowitz?O? Couldn't stick with

it long
enough to get your PhD?
Howard： I'm an engineer. Most engineers
don't bother with a PhD. But you may be in-
terested to know I designed the zero-gravity
waste-disposal system for NASA.
Mrs. Latham： Got it④
you re a space plum-
Howard： I'm gonna go hit the bar.
Mrs. Latham： Tell me about these two.
Raj：

Dr. Siebert： Dr. Hofstadter is representing5
our experimental physics program tonight.1
fascinating work.
Mrs. Latham： Right.Fascinate me. They're
cute when they're about to wet themselves，
aren't they?

for a long time and I am wondering what

sure， and going to that pointless soiree， l
stayed right here and did a load of whites
Amy： Well， normally I respect your macho re-
bellious attitude toward “The Man”， but， in
this case， I think you've made a foolish mis-
take.
Sheldon：
：Unlikely.But make your case.
Keeping in mind that your critical attitude is
ruiningour Saturday night together，and
I'm not above minimizing your window.O2
Amy： Sheldon， like it or not， until you man-
age to upload your intelligence into a self-
sustaining orbiting satellite， equipped with
high-speed Internet and a cloaking device，
you will be dependent on other members of
the human race.

Tonight? Sure， that'd be great. Okay， I'll
see you then. Bye. She wants to have din-

research? Where you going? The drive-thru
at Jack in the Box?

strong. Can we talk in private?
Priya： Sure.
Raj： No!O4 It's completely inappropriate for
a single woman to entertain a man in pri-

The
Hindu
Code of Manu is very clear in these mat-
ters. If a woman's father is not around， the
duty of controlling her base desires falls to
the closest male member of her family， in
this case， Raj. The code also states that if
she disobeys， she will be “reborn in the
womb of a jackal and tormented by disea-
ses”. If true， that seems like an awfully large
gamble given that the prize is Leonard.
Raj： There it is， Priya. We're Indian. We be-
lieve this stuff.
Priya： I think it also says that if you eat beef，
3
you need to live with cows for three months
and drink their urine.

some of it's
crazy.4 My point is， you can't go out with⑤

up① the pieces of your broken heart.
Penny： Amy， I'm fine.
Amy： You don’t have to be strong? for me.
Penny： What?
Amy： In situations like this， best girlfriends are
often catty about the other woman.
Penny： Really，I am not upset about Leonard
and Priya.
Amy： Oh. Then perhaps you don't understand
what's going on. Your former boyfriend has

Amy： Are you familiar with Meme Theory?
Sheldon：
：I'm familiar with everything， but
go on.O
Amy： Meme Theory suggests that items of gos-
sip are like living things that seek to re-
produce using humans as their host.
Sheldon： I'm no stranger to memetic epidemi-
ology. At Johnson Elementary School， the
spread like wildfire.
Amy： I should think so.
That's goad.O
Sheldon： Your meme hypothesis does intrigue
me. How might we examine this more closely?
Amy： Do you have any ethical qualms regard-
inghuman experimentation?
Sheldon：
：It's one of the few forms of inte-
raction with5
people that I don't find repe-
llent.O3
Amy： We need to fabricate a tantalizing piece
of gossip and a second non-tantalizing piece
to use as a control. Then we'll track its pro-
gress through our social group and interpret

the results through the competing academic
prisms of memetic theory， algebraic gossip
and epidemiology.

Sheldon： Leonard， are you in the shower?
Leonard：
can't hear you!O I’m in
the
shower!
Sheldon： I asked if you were in the shower，
but that's moot now!
Leonard： What?
Sheldon：
Moot!O? Rendered unimportant by
recent events!
Leonard： I can't hear you! I'm in the shower!
Sheldon： I have to skipthe chitchat. Emer-
gency.
Leonard： What kind of emergency?
Sheldon：
You get mathematicalO：-32-ounce
banana smoothie，16-ounce bladder.
Leonard： You might not want to do that.

Sheldon： I assureyou I do.
Leonard： Sheldon， I'm not alone in here.
Sheldon： What? What are you doing in there?

Leonard： We were in here first； you can't be
She can't be in here!
in here.
Sheldon： According to the roommate agree-
ment， paragraph nine， subsection B，“The
right to bathroom privacy is suspendedin
the event of force majeure.”And believe
am experiencing a very majeure
force.O4
242
don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
Both sides in the conflict have agreed tem-
243
00：02：15—00：03：28
Sheldon： Very well. “Count the first：
On or about the 28th day of April， the
accused did knowingly and with malice
aforethought deny access to the shared
bathroom in a time of emergency，to
wit， my back teeth were floating.
Count the second： the accused excee-
ded the agreed upon occupancy of the
shower， to wit， one， unless we are un-
der attack by water-soluble aliens.”
Priya： Can I see the roommate agreement?
Sheldon： Um， it's fairly technical.O
Priya： I think I can handle i
it.

Sheldon：[

here，“on the right to enter the bath-
room in emergency situations”， is not
specific as to what constitutes

an e-
mergency.
Sheldon：Oh， that's ridiculous! A bath-
room emergency is self-explanatory.
Priya： Is it? If Leonard forgot to trim his
nose hair， could he barge in while you
were showering?
to the fundamental facilities in the school.

the most delightfully cruel thing we ve done
to Sheldon since we left that fake message
from Stephen Hawking on his voice mail.
Priya： Seriously?
Howard： I wish to discuss your theories of
black holes. Meet me at the Randy s Donut
by the airport at 2 ：00 a. m.
Sheldon： What is that you're eating? Tonight
is pizza night.
Leonard： I'd like to refer that tomy attorney.
Priya： According to what I see here， Thursday
nights are Franconi's pizza night.
Sheldon： Yes， and when Franconi's went out
of business， we switched to  Graziano's.
Howard：
That's interesting. Can you just
switch restaurants like that， Priya?
Priya： A good question， Howard. Turns out
you can't. According to the document you
drew up④， Sheldon， the selection of a new
takeout restaurant requires public hearings
and a 60-day comment period.
Were those
criteria met?O2
Sheldon：No.O3
Howard & Leonard & Raj：

me eat lamb. Congratulations. Pizza night
will now be at your apartment. Order one.
Penny： Oh，I'm sorry， honey，I'm meeting
Amy and Bernadette for dinner. But you're
welcome to tag along.
Sheldon： A girls' night?OOh， I don’t know
if I’m up for② an evening talking about rain-
bows， unicorns and menstrual cramps.
Penny： Okay，suit yourself. We'll probably
be trashing Priya a little.
Penny： Okay， I'd like to propose a toast to a
wonderful girls' night out.
Amy： Fair④ warning
we can get ca-razy.
Bernadette： Yeah. Last week we smoked cigars
and pretended5 to be dragons.
Sheldon： Really，Amy?Tobacco and alcohol?③：
coveries were made by people having a
good time?
Amy： Why did you bring him? He's hushing my
buzz.

a hard time⑥.

Amy： My burps taste like cranberry juice.

Sheldon： And there's your answer.O?
Amy： Would you like to come in for a night-
Sheldon： If you're referring to  the beverage，
you know I don't drink. If you’re referring to
the hat you don while wearing a nightshirt
and holding a candle， I have one.
Sheldon： It's hard to say no to Yoo-hoo. The
name literally beckons.

Amy： Make yourself comfortable.
Sheldon： Thank you. Is someone smoking?
Amy： Oh，that's just Ricky.O3
Sheldon： You owna smoking monkey?

my department's nicotine addiction study.
Sheldon： What's he doing here?

Sheldon： Remarkable. Aren't you worried a-
bout secondhand smoke?

new and improved roommate agreement that
benefitsme greatly. I’d like you to sign it.
Leonard： Why would I want to do that?
Sheldon： E
Excellent question.Do you re-
member what happened to the alien， played
by talented character actor Frank Gorshin?，
in the Star Trek episode“Let That Be Your
Last Battlefield”?
Leonard： Uh， Captain Kirk activated the self-
destruct sequence and threatened to blow
upthe Enterprise and kill them both unless
he gave in①.
Sheldon：Affirmative.O Computer， this is
Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Activate self-destruct
sequence. Code 11A2B.
Leonard： What are you gonna do， Sheldon?
Blow up the apartment?

Amy： Of course. How does the cheetah attack

weakest member.
Bernadette：
Well， what makes me the we-

Amy： Your trusting nature coupled with

It's what I do.O：But

wait，
there's more. I also invented two new
old woman.
Leonard： Okay， now I have to ask. What
do they do?
Sheldon： When the serpent slithers to an
opposing player's piece， that piece is
considered poisoned and will die after
two more moves. Unless... it gets to the
old woman in time③， in which case she
sucks out the poison， turning her into

the power of the Knight， Queen and
Serpent.

The History of Everything
Our whole universe was in a hot dense state，
Then nearly fourteen billion years ago expansion started. Wait.
The Earth began to cool，
The autotrophs began to drool，
Neanderthals developed tools.
We built a wall (we built the pyramids)，
Math， science，history， unraveling the mysteries，
Since the dawn of man is really not that long，
As every galaxy was formed in less time than it takes to sing this song.
A fraction of a second and the elements were made.
The bipeds stood up straight.
The dinosaurs all met their fate，
They tried to leap but they were late，
And they all died (they froze their asses off).
The oceans and pangea，
See ya， wouldn't wanna be ya!
Set in motion by the same big bang!
It all started with the big bang!
It's expanding ever outward but one day
It will cause the stars to go the other way，
Collapsing ever inward， we won’t be here， it won't be hurt.
Our best and brightest figure that it'll make an even bigger bang!
Australopithecus would really have been sick of us
Debating out while here they're catching deer (we're catching viruses).
Religion or astronomy， Encarta， Deuteronomy，
It all started with the big bang!
Music and mythology， Einstein and astrology，
It all started with the big bang!

My mother's fried chicken is why
we had to buy my dad the extra-large
coffin.O
Leonard： Sheldon， she just got off the plane.
She doesn't want to cook.
Sheldon： Of course she does. Making me food
is her way of saying“I love you”.
Making
me food when she's too tired to cook is
her way of saying “I really love you”

out for a bite④，Sheldon.

chicken you're going to make me?

ing out. Do you like sushi? There’s a great

little place down the street.

harm in trying something new.

Mrs. Cooper：How are you doing on the young
lady front? I hear you're in some sort of a
long distance situation?
Leonard：Yeah， it's Raj's sister. It's kind of
tough. She's in India. Also， her parents
aren't happy she's dating someone white.
Mrs. Cooper： Oh，that's funny turn， isn't it?
You never think about it going the other
way.O： Well，you can't force things. You
need to figure out if you're in a relationship
or if you're just calling it one. It's like they
say...a cat can have kittens in the oven
but that don't make 'em biscuits.O3

mom to see the Hollywood sign， the wax
museum③， the Walk of Fame④.

Amy： How did you get into my apartment?
Sheldon： Wow. Is that the kind of nagging
can expect now that you re my girlfriend?
Good thing I drew this up
①
③1
Amy： What's that?
Sheldon：
I present to you the relationship
agreement.O A binding covenant③
that，
in its 31 pages， enumerates， iterates and
codifies the rights and responsibilities of
Sheldon Lee Cooper， here and after known
as“the boyfriend”， and Amy Farrah Fowl-
er，
er
re and after known as“ the girl-
friend”.
Amy： It's so romantic.O3
don't you start perusing while I set up my
notary stamp.
Amy：“Section 5： Hand-holding. Hand-holding
is only allowed under the following circum-
stances. A： Either party is in danger of fall-
ing off a cliff， precipice or ledge；B：Either
party is deserving of a hearty handshake
after winning a Nobel Prize；C：Moral
support during flu shots.”Seems a bit re-
strictive.
Sheldon： Feel free to retain a lawyer.

Sheldon： You asked Penny if she wanted to
hear something weird.
Leonard：
Yeah，because I have something
weird to tell her.C2
Penny： What's yours?
Leonard： There's this guy， Jimmy Speckerman，
who used to torment me in high school. He
sent me a message through Facebook. He's
in town and wants to have drinks.
Sheldon： Okay，Penny，

Leonard： Sure. You want to see what all the
scientists are wearing this year.
Sheldon：Look at these men.
They ve man-
aged to win the top science prize in the
world with no more understanding of the
quantum underpinnings
of the expan-
sion of the early universe than God gave
a goose
③
? You should pay attention，
Leonard.
Someday this could be you up
there.C3
Leonard：Thanks.
Sheldon： So， what's got you up? Did you have
a bad clam?
Leonard：l didn't have clams.
Sheldon： 1 don't watch you 24 hours a day.l
don't know what you do.
Leonard： It's this Jimmy Speckerman thing. I
can't decide if I should agree to see him or
not. Of course that might be because the
last time I ran into him， he made me floss
with my own shoelaces.
Sheldon： Wear loafers④. Look at Dr. Saul
Perlmutter up there， clutching that Nobel
Prize. What's the matter，Saul?
You afraid
someone's going to steal it? Like you stole
Einstein's cosmological constant?4

Jimmy： Wow. Look at you. Little Leonard

Sheldon： And there's the first zinger. Ouch.C1
Leonard： I'm doing okay， I guess.
Jimmy： Okay? Come on， I read online you're
a physicist at a university， you won some
medal.
Jimmy： Yeah， congratulations.
Sheldon： Congratulations? The Newcomb Medal?
Oh，please.
That's the scientific equivalent
of a smiley face sticker on your home-
work.O2
Jimmy： From what I read， it sounded like a
big deal④.
Sheldon： Oh， good Lord，
are we going to stand
here and listen to him tear Leonard apart
like this?O3
Raj： Hey， I won a Newcomb Medal， too.
Sheldon： My point.
Jimmy： You should have seen this guy back in
the day. Huh? He was so little， he could fit
Oh， man， how did you get inside that back-
pack?

helped a lot.O4

Jimmy： What is that?

against Leonard.
One of which is certainlv
the cause of him wetting his bedwell into
his teens.

Leonard： 14 is not... aw， never mind.
Jimmy： What's this word?
Leonard： Nancy.
You called me Nancy for
three years.
Sheldon：
You really need to work on your pen-
manship.O2
Jimmy： Oh，man， I... I don't know what to
say. l always thought we were just having
some fun.
Leonard： It wasn't fun for me.
ruined him.
Leonard： Come on， guys.
Raj： That was pretty badass， dude.
It's yet another way
I'm exactly like Batman

Leonard： No，no，no，come on in. I'll make
you a cup of coffee.
Jimmy： I wouldn't be imposing??
Leonard：No.
Sheldon： Yes.
Leonard： Sheldon， we can't let him drive.
Sheldon：l
Then take away his keys and make
him wander  the streets with the other
drunks.O2
Leonard： You remember Sheldon and Raj and
Howard.
Jimmy： Not really， no. It's funny， huh， Leon-
ard? Back in school， I was the winner and
we're re-
versed. You're the winner.
Sheldon：Y
：You'd think a winner could make
cup of cocoa.O3
Jimmy： You mind if I use bathroom?
Leonard： Yeah， just back there.
Howard： How about that? After all these years，
your big bad high school bully finally apolo-

This world's going to
chew you up
 and spit you out.?
Jimmy： When did I have tacos②?
Leonard： Morning， Jimmy.
Sheldon： Oh， there it is， tacos.
Jimmy： Man， I tied one on③.
Leonard： Yeah， you did. So， uh， listen， it
was great to see you again. And thanks for
the apology.
Jimmy： What apology?
Leonard： For all the crappy④ stuff you did to
me in high school.
Jimmy：
Geez， you re still harping onthat?
What a puss.
O3

Leonard： That's my French toast.
Jimmy： It's good. You really know your way
around a kitchen， Nancy.
Sheldon： I'm not going to say I told you so，
but we could have killed him.

I might kill him right now.

Sheldon： That is superb. This morning I made
a
palindromewith my
with my Alpha-Bits.
It is
“Nice hat， Bob Tahecin.”1
Amy： Sounds like you hit the ground running?.
I have a bit of good news myself. My most
recent paper on how a cooperative long-
te
erm potentiation can map memory
se-
quences

cover of Neuron③.
Sheldon：
Ooh!
Speaking of good
news，
Amy： That's nice. Anyway， I've been drea-
ming of this day.
n： Me too. Triple digits， I'm not gonna
lie... it feels pretty good.
Amy： Sheldon，I'm the sole author on a paper
being published in a distinguished journal5
Sheldon：

Ooh， 101! Air's getting a bit thin up
here.O3
Penny： So， are we ready to order?
Amy： Give me a minute. I'm gonna go wash
up.

ed for being overly fond of koala bears
I don't know what it is， when they start
munching
③
on eucalyptus， I just melt
inside.O1
Penny： Okay，Amy just told you some exciting
news， and you acted like it was no big
deal.
Sheldon： Oh， I see why you're confused. No，
her news
s sounded important，but
itv
what
you're forgetting is， it was an achievement
in the field of biology.
That's all about
yucky， squishy things.
Penny：Honey，she's upset. You're her boy-
friend. You have to at least try to be excit-
ed by the things she's excited by.
Sheldon： What if they simply don't excite me?
Penny：
Well， just smile and think about koa-

She knows my koala

Leonard： You want to talk about it?
Sheldon： No. I think I'll just go in this saloon①
and drink my troubles away.
Leonard： You know digital alcohol is never a
solution.What's going on?
Sheldon： Hard as this may be to believe， it's
possible that I'm not boyfriend material
124
Leonard：
Glad I was sitting down for that.
Did you and Amy get in a fight?
Sheldon： Amy had a fight. I was being per-
fectly reasonable. I'm gonna have a whis-

Leonard： Okay， let's talk about that.
Sheldon： As you know， lizards... cold-blooded
animals... lack the ability to sense tempera-
ture. But they do move more sluggishly
when it's cold.

Leonard： Where on earth⑤
did you get that
from?
Sheldon： It's in her book， Needy Baby， Greedy

It's called nonfiction for a reason.

dreamed of moving to L. A. and becoming
a movie star. Anyway， after four years of
acting lessons and waiting tables②，I've
done a hemorrhoid commercial， and a pro-
duction of Anne Frank3

true. Your turn.

research is with high-powered lasers， and，
oh， I've just gotten a big government grant，
to see if they can be used to knock out，
incoming ballistic missiles.

Leonard： Oh， God， no. The money's pretty
good. And I used the equipment to make my

welcome to the premiere episode of Sheldon

Over
the next 52 weeks， you and I are going
to explore the dynamic world of vexil-
lology

Amy： Hang on， Dr. C. What's vexillology?
Sheldon： Vexillology is the study of flags.
Amy： Cool. I think I just learned something.
Sheldon： Did you have fun doing it?
Amy： I'll say.
Sheldon： Fun and information are two sides to
this video podcast，not unlike the only
two-sided state flag... Oregon③. Oh， look.
Hello，Mr.E
Beaver. In future episodes，
we'll
answer
rs
some burning④
questions：
What's the only non-rectangular5
flag?

What
animal appears most often on flags? What
animal appears second most often on flags?

out. Made it easier on her when I broke
things off①

Leonard： How about this， are you familiar with
the typical development for computer soft-
ware?
Penny：
You know， just for fun， let's say I'm
not.O1
Leonard： Before an application is released，
they give it a trial run②. W... We could do
that.
And if we hit a rough spot， instead
of getting mad， just say，“Hey， we fou-
nd a bug
and we report it so it can be
fixed.O2
Penny： You mean like a beta test?
Leonard： Well，technically，this would be an
alpha test. A beta test requires people
that weren't involved in9 the development
of the appli...
ing beta test?
Leonard： No，you should. Absolutely.
That
was me being pedantic.
That's our first
bug. You reported it. I can fix that. See?
This is good.
.O4
Penny： All right. Let's give it a shot.

list. At some point， we'll exchange.

that wasn't discovered until they competed
against each other at the 1936 Olympics③.
And thankfully，their embarrassment

was
overshadowed by the rise of Fascism④

brother's hair. I could do it for you.

Sheldon： I'm sorry. It's the bad boy attitude
that comes with this hair.O3
Raj：You could go to my guy. He's at Juan-Juan
in Beverly Hills④. They bring you a cup of
tea； they'll massage your scalp. It's about
$200，but sometimes you look in the next
chair and you see a superstar like Tony
Danza⑤.
Howard： Quick question here：
tually changed the conversation from “I'm
going to astronaut training”to“Sheldon
can't get a haircut”?

and I'm running out of time. My hair
ris

femtosecond. I mean， if you're quiet， you
can hear it.O2
Amy： What about Supercuts?
Sheldon： I tried once. They do men's and
women's hair in the same room at the same

mousse.
Amy： Well， this isn't a crisis. Why don't you
just let your hair grow out a little?
Sheldon： Why don't I let my hair grow out?
Um，
，why don't I start wearing Birkens-
tocks

“Can you dig it?”

Amy： Well，I don't know. I think you might

Oh， please， everyone knows what's

What are you going to do

Sheldon： I don't know. I could do anything. All
bets are off. The world is my oyster5. I got
it. I'm going to put on my Tuesday pajamas
tonight.
Leonard： I got to tell you， I'm a little worried
about him.
Penny： If I were you，

value. But remember， like me， you also
have a human half.
Sheldon： Well， I'm not going to dignify that

Spock： Consider this. What is the purpose of a
toy?

Oh， if I got on the bridge of the
Enterprise， I would never， ever leave.

Spock：
Trust me， it gets old after a while. O?
You must right your wrongs， Sheldon.
Sheldon： Why? I got away with it. Leonard

it， so he won't know it's broken. And I have
a toy that isn't broken. Everybody's happy.

Sheldon： I wish you could all be inside my
head.
The conversation is sparkling. Fine，
I‘'ll tell you. 1 A lichen①
is an organism
made up of two separate species，fungi②
and algae③. lf you could merge with④
an-
other species， what species would you pick
None of you will get it.
Raj： Okay，I'd pick swan because， uh，
，the
resulting hybrid would have the advanced
industrial civilization of a human and the
long graceful neck I've always dreamed
of having.O2
Sheldon： Wrong. Leonard?
Leonard： Horse，but mostly just for the height.
A little bit for the genital girth.
Sheldon：
Wrong， and let's keep it clean，
shall we?O3
Howard： Kangaroo⑤， uh， I’d be Kanga-Jew. The
first of my people to dunk⑥ a basketball.
Leonard： Also instead of just living in your
mother's house， you could actually live
inside her body.③4
Sheldon： Clever， but also wrong.
g. No，the
best organism for human beings to merge
with is the lichen itself. That way， you'd be
human，fungus， and algae. Triple threat.

miles per hour， and the only thing that slows
you down is a little parachute that pops out
right before you crash into the ground. And

Our whole universe was in a hot dense state，
Then nearly fourteen billion years ago expansion started. Wait.
The Earth began to cool，
The autotrophs began to drool，
Neanderthals developed tools.
We built a wall (we built the pyramids)，
Math， science， history， unraveling the mysteries，
That all started with the big bang!
Since the dawn of man is really not that long，
As every galaxy was formed in less time than it takes to sing this song.
A fraction of a second and the elements were made.
The bipeds stood up straight.
They tried to leap but they were late.
And they all died (they froze their asses off).
The oceans and pangea，
See ya， wouldn't wanna be ya!
Set in motion by the same big bang!
It all started with the big bang!
It's expanding ever outward but one day
Collapsing ever inward， we won’t be here， it won’t be hurt.
Our best and brightest figure that it'll make an even bigger bang!
Australopithecus would really have been sick of us
Debating out while here they re catching deer (we're catching viruses).
Religion or astronomy，Encarta， Deuteronomy，
It all started with the big bang!
Music and mythology，Einstein and astrology，
It all started with the big bang!
It all started with the big bang!

Sheldon： Leonard， where do you stand on
the anthropic principle?
Leonard： Interesting question. On the one hand²，
I always thought...
Sheldon：
You don't even know what it is， do
you?③ The anthropic principle states that
if we wish to explain why our universe exists
the way it does， the answer is that it must
have qualities that allow intelligent crea-
tures to arise who are capable of asking
the question. As I am doing so eloquently
right now.
Leonard： I know what the anthropic principle
is.
Sheldon：
Of course. I just explained it to
2
you.2 Now， where do you stand on it?
Leonard： Where do you stand on it?
Sheldon： Strongly pro④.
Leonard：
Then I believe that god created the
world in six days， and on the seventh.

be an intimate group of five.
Now、we're
going to be a... faceless mass of six.
Leonard： It'll be fine. Just， uh， pretend he's
Wolowitz.
Sheldon： Hmm. Do you like Raisinets?
Stuart： l can take them or leave them.
Sheldon： At the movies， Wolowitz always
eats Raisinets.
Stuart： Would you feel more comfortable if I
ate Raisinets?
Sheldon：
Well， it's hardly
my business what
you eat. as long as
it doesn't crunch
during the film and it's Raisinets.O3
Stuart： Okay. Should we go?
Sheldon： Yeah， but， one more question. If
you're going to replace Wolowitz， I need to
know a little more about you.

Wrong. She just took a sip from his
Diet Dr. Pepper.
Sheldon：
So， if she wants to end her pair-
bond with Leonard， why on earth
21
would
she guzzle a witches' brew of his soda
and spit?O?
Amy： It's complicated
Sheldon：
：
String theory is complicated. That's
just yucky. Don't get any ideas.O： All
right， for the sake of argument， let's say
that's true. Why doesn't Penny just end the
relationship?
Amy： She's not sure how she feels.
Sheldon：l
How can she not be sure how she
18
feels? You know， when I have a feeling，
know it. Trains? Love them. Swordfish?

love them， too. They re fish with a sword
for a nose.O4

Sheldon： Now you're asking me toI
keep a
secret from my best friend， colleague，and
roommate?

it. Hand-holding? Not a fan. Hammerhead
shark? I love that thing. Yeah， it's another
fish with a tool on its head.

Sheldon： Excuse me. This is not about protec-
ting my friend. I'm a big fan of homeosta-
sis. Do you know what that is?
Penny： Of course not.
Sheldon： Yeah. Homeostasis refers toa sys-
tem's ability to regulate its internal environ-
ment and maintain a constant condition of
7
properties like temperature or PH.
Penny：
Worst bedtime story ever. O2
Sheldon： My point is I don’t like when things
change. So， regardless of your feelings， l
would like you to continue dating Leonard.
2
And also， while we re on the subject. you
recently changed your shampoo. I'm not
comfortable with the new scent. Please
stop this madness and go back to green

out， and until I do， you are not to say a

Howard：
The other astronauts are being mean
to me.O1
Bernadette： No， what are they doing?
Howard： Well， like for instance，the other
day when I was asleep. one of the guys
went on a space walk and glued a big-eyed
rubber alien mask to the outside of my win-
dow. When I woke up， I screamed for like

“Being mean
is lame. What's cool is being nice.”O3

the first guy in space to get a wedgie.

gers； she pets
unfamiliar dogs： and it is
ridiculously easy to break into her apart-
ment. lf I were you ， I'd get a backup.

care about with some other random person.

should find someone to do it for me.
You

standing of science. but whose real talents
lie in menial labor.O2

Sheldon： The original title was A Rederivation
of Maxwell 's Equations Regarding Elec-

some of the more religious people in town
were starting to say I was a witch.
Alex： Sheldon thinks the approach in this pa-

Oh， it's about time. I hated the old

Earlier today， I invited Professor Stephen

he accepted my request. Do you understand
what that means?I'll walk you through it.
The game is not called “Words with st-
rangers”. No， it's not even called “Words
with acquaintances”. It is called “Words
with... Friends”! It's “Words with friends”!
Which Stephen Hawking and I officially

are.O Now all I need is a bunk bed with a

since I was six years old.

Raj：
Sheldon， you okay?O
Sheldon： It's been three days. Why hasn't
Stephen Hawking played a word?
Raj： The guy's a genius. Maybe you weren't
challenging enough for him.

Not challenging? I was humiliating
the man. I was thinking of writing a book
called
I"a brief history of the time I made
Stephen Hawking cry like a little girl”.

Howard：
There's the problem.
You can't
beat Hawking like that. He hates to lose.
Everyone knows the guy's a big baby. l
in a stroller. One time when I was working
with him， he said that Johnny Depp was in
The Matrix. I told him he was wrong， but
he kept insisting⑤. So I looked it up⑥ online

and showed him.

had a pizza party， and everyone got

magic. I would do little shows for her， hang

the act， I would say I needed a volunteer

Sheldon： I'm sorry... 294? That's my parking
spot.
Raj： Why do you have a parking spot? You
don't have a car. You don't evendrive.
Sheldon： doesn't matter That's my spo③
you never use it.
Howard： Sheldon， someday， if you get a car，
I'm sure they'll give you another parking
space.
Sheldon：
：I don't want another parking space.
I want my parking space. It's perfect. It's a
corner spot， cutting the risk of door-dings in
half. It’s a mere 28 steps from the building
entrance. The nearby tree provides shade
on hot days and is also home to a delightful
squirrel， which is fortuitous because mos
squirrels are real jerks.
98
Howard： Fun story. Meanwhile，you still don’t
have a car.
Sheldon：
：Don’t try to change the subject. This
is about a parking space. It has nothing to
do with

cars.O3

Sheldon：l
I always listen to myself. It's one
of the great joys of my life. ④ Now， get
your car out of my spot.
Howard： Nope.

Sheldon： President Siebert， listen to reason.
Yeah， I understand I don't use the parking
spot， but that's not the point. l... yes， I'm
aware

you told me not to call you at home.
But you didn't answer the door! And

go to the international space station.

Yeah， that was five weeks ago.
How much longer is he gonna milk that
cow?

Leonard： Sheldon， let it go. It’s not a big deal.
Sheldon： No， no， this is a slippery slope，
Leonard. It starts with a parking space.
Where does it end?
It's like my dad always
said. first they say you can't drink and
drive. Next thing you know， you can’t let
your 10-year-old take the wheel while you
sleep one off in the backseat.O3
Leonard： All that story does is make me feel
bad for your mother.
Sheldon： Leonard， you're my best friend.
Why don't you ever take my side?

your side! 4

mash up Benadryl in his ice cream to get
him to fall asleep. I'm really sorry they took
Sheldon's spot away. He shouldn't have to

and when he makes a worthwhilecontribu-

subject.

Howard： I had no idea how much that spot
meantto you. Anyway， I called President
Siebert and told him it's not worth① fighting
over the spot， so you keep it， and I'll park
in the structure across the street.
Sheldon：
Well，Howard， thank you. It's
quite a gestureon your part. You've
shown yourself to be the bigger man， which

I find totally unacceptable. I must be
the bigger man. Therefore， you may use my
spot until such time as I learn to drive or
get a Batmobile.C2

It's not our fault. Our dads never
did anything like this with us.O2

I thought our relationship was based
on
trust and a mutual admiration that
skews in my favor.  It pains me to say
it， but I think some form of penalty is in or-

havior in the future. In a perfect world， l'd
lock you in a stockade in the public square.
That probably requires a permit.
Amy： I could not be allowed to go to the open-

Sheldon：
Oh， that seems overly harsh. You

tell them it's me， and I don't want to answer
a lot of questions about if I really am who I
say I am， you know? I just... I want this
done.
.No， I am not the person who just
called. That man was clearly a cowboy.

Why
do they keep hanging up on me?
Amy： Well，what I think is going on here is you
have a pathological need for closure.
Sheldon：
Oh， that's nonsense. I mean， you
tell me stories about your day all the t-
ime. I don't care how they end.3
Amy： You know， I might be able to help you
with this. There's a whole field of behavior-
al neuroscience that examines③ ways to re-
train your neural pathways④ so stuff like this
bothers⑤ you less.
Sheldon： Yeah， but I just told you， I don't
have a problem with closure.
Amy： You sure about that?
Sheldon：Oh，quitesure. That proves no-
thing.(

Leonard： So，did you love
it? Of course
you loved it. How could you not love it?
Tell me how much you loved it.
Penny： It was cute.
Leonard： Oh， don’t say cute. That’s the worst. It
just makes things seem small. It diminish-
esthem. I just... I don't understand how
you can watcha show that great and not
be excited by it.
Penny： I liked it. I'm excited.
Leonard： Well， then， tell your face.O2
Penny： What do you want from me?
Leonard： You know what? Never mind. We
gave it a shot. Let's just see what el-
se is on.O3
Well... I'm sorry I called it cute. Let's
watch another one.
Penny：
Yeah. it was fun. Kind of reminded
me of my
high school. But instead of
vampires， we had meth heads

.But b-
oth came out at night and had messed

up teeth.O
Leonard： All right， cool. I... I think you'll like
the next one better. All the cheerleaders

Sheldon：

a

●1Tic-
tac-toe
can only end in win， lose or
draw... none of which will deny② me clo-
sure. Especially since I’m about to win. B...
Amy： Exactly. How does that make you feel?
Sheldon：
The same way any normal person
would . Feel like I want to peel
off my
own face and tear
0
it in two and then

again and again until I have a handful of
Sheldon-face confetti.O2
Amy： And that's exactly the feeling we want to
address⑤ with this course of treatment.
Sheldon： Yeah， or you could pitch in， grab a
nostril and help me get this face off.
Amy： Come on， you can do this.
Sheldon：
You don't know what it's like to
feel completely frustrated. To have a...
a desire build up within you and be de-
nied any opportunity for release.
